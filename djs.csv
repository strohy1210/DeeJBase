Spanky Has never been one to follow the rules. The Long Island native’s proficiency behind the turntables is due to his refusal to conform to the norm.

As a result of his childhood curiosities. Spanky has taken the same inquisitive spirit and applied it to his craft today, finding tracks suitable for creatively remixing some of the music industry’s most popular records. Spanky earned his moniker at the age of 10, when he would sneak out of bed at night to play with his father’s record collection on a set of turntables. Once his parents caught wind of his after-hours antics, he was immediately compared to the problem child of The Little Rascals fame, Spanky. Rather than stifle his passion, Spanky’s father embraced it, bringing him along to local house parties he would spin at. Occasionally, Spanky had the opportunity to spin a few records himself.

As the years progressed, Spanky had one goal: to score gigs as a professional DJ. With that in mind, he would stand outside many New York City hot spots and hand out his mixtapes to club owners and promoters. His mission was to prove that his knack for blending records at 16 years old was up to par with the city’s premiere turntablists. “I love music down to the simple sounds of the boom bap to a hip-hop track,” says Spanky, who cites DJ AM ,DJ A Trak , DJ Vice DJ Kid Capri, DJ Qbert, DJ Enuff and DJ Riz as influences. “Being able to play music and have a crowd of people react to each track you scratch or blend gives me a feeling that I can’t explain.”

His tenacity caught the eyes and ears of many club promoters in the tri-state area, and in 2006, though he wasn’t officially on a major radio station, Spanky was asked to do a live Saturday broadcast from a popular Queens nightclub. The live airing sounded off on New York City’s La Kalle 105.9. Despite Spanky not working at the station full-time, he earned the respect of the station’s colleagues for his professionalism on the microphone and his ability to rock crowds with ease.

In 2007, while attending St. Johns University, Spanky created what many veteran DJs before him have failed to capitalize on: he put together his own college tour. The mixer landed at such lauded institutions as the University of Illinois, Boston University, University of Southern California, and University of South Florida, among others. Later that same year, Spanky found himself spinning records inside Madison Square Garden to a crowd of over 25,000 patrons for concerts sponsored by La Kalle 105.9 and La Mega 97.9. Spanky has also held a two-year residency at the legendary club Pacha, as well as spun records at Duvet, China Club, Latin Quarters, Copacabana and Webster Hall.

These days, DJ Spanky’s presence is cemented on traditional radio airwaves, inside nightclubs and on Internet radio stations. Every week, Spanky commands crowds three to four nights throughout the tri-state area in a variety of venues. He also appears each Tuesday and Thursday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time for the “Certified Radio” show on AListRadio.net, where he showcases his talents spinning top 40 and house. DJ Spanky also holds a weekly spot on Nyc’s Now 92.3 Fm, where he can be heard Fridays Nights/Saturday mornings from 2 A.m. to 3 A.m. Listeners worldwide can also tune into www.now923.com to hear him spin. Besides those stations, Spanky’s sonic blend of tunes are available www.soundcloud.com/dj-spanky and his personal website, IAmDJSpanky.com

Keeping in tune with today’s advanced technologies, DJ Spanky has created a suite of mobile applications encompassing the largest range of smart phones, including the iPhone, and Android. Which are under Reconstruction. He will be releasing a new and improved version very soon Users can remain up-to-date with his touring schedule and his signature remixes. For a DJ set on topping every one of his past accomplishments, giving up is never an option. “Quitting is a weakness that I cannot afford to have,” says Spanky. One look at his resume proves he’s in this game for the long haul.",2014-12-19 22:14:03.130728,2015-01-08 01:01:08.290644,,,info@iamdjspanky.com,,t,4448,363447,New York,,f,,f,So-Dope,25,618570568203730,"So Dope is a Rap group coming out of the UK.

By the time he was in middle school, he and his twin brother, Jason, were writing songs and performing locally. While in High school, they toured, produced their own albums and topped local radio charts. 

During college, Josh and his brother moved to Nashville and began working with award-winning producer John Mark Painter [Ben Folds, Alva Leigh, Fleming & John]. In 2008 the brothers signed with Dweeb Records as the duo, Pantana.

Living in Nashville has provided great schooling for Josh. From writing with names like Thad Cockrell, Marcus Hummon, Phil Madeira, Fleming McWilliams, John Mark Painter, Josh Doyle, Sam Ashworth, Keith Everett Smith, Tami Hinesh, and Luke Sheets, to performing events such as Tin Pan South, songwriter’s rounds and The Basement’s New Faces Night and sharing the stage with the likes of Hummon, Jane Deere Girls, Amanda Williams, King Billy, and Meredith Andrews, to name a few, Josh has a recognizable and respected name in town.

After 11 years of touring and recording with Pantana, Josh is branching out for his first solo effort. The alternative-pop influenced EP, Lay Low, brings to light his personal musical stylings with songs that need to be sung, rhythms that need to be felt, and melodies that need to be heard. With sounds reminiscent of U2, David Gray, The Killers and Springsteen, Josh implements his unique approach, finding a balance between new and familiar.

Lay Low is currently available digitally through iTunes, Amazon.com, Rhapsody, Spotify and Myspace Music. Josh is gearing up to hit the road in support of the EP and making plans to record a full-length album.

If you ask Josh what he wants from music, he will tell you he simply wants to make music that people rely on—music that relates to our daily lives and reflects the joy and sadness, victory and defeats each of us encounter in our lifetime.

      New York music producer LUZCID has come a long way in the short time he has been a performing artist in the EDM scene. Originally his interest was sparked by heavy hitting OGs such as Bassnectar, Zeds Dead, Excision and Nero to name a few. He soon knew he needed to start producing music like this of his own. LUZCID's music is an energetic blend of influences from an array of genres including Hip-Hop, Funk, Disco, Metal, House, R&B, Breaks, Drum and Bass and Club to name a few. His music is constantly evolving to push the boundaries of what is accepted in mainstream clubs. Far from cookie cutter his music has been described as ""Trippy"", ""Hyper-Progressive"" and ""A Mind Fuck"". 

        He has the dedication and work ethic of a ""bedroom producer"" but is far from that. LUZCID states, “To give the crowd the best experience possible you must first be a part of them"". He regularly attends shows and festivals all over the US and you won't find him anywhere near the VIP or backstage areas. He holds down the front row dancing and sweating in the middle of the crowds. As much as he is an artist he is an even bigger fan. A fan of everything the music scene has to offer. LUZCID views the scene as much more than just a music community. He believes it is the start of a global change of consciousness. The world we live in is plagued with social and political problems that are all within our power to solve. As long as we work together. The world can learn a lot from the ideals of the music scene we are currently building. Thanks to the massive growth of music festivals around the world people from different continents can communicate without saying a word. The cringe of a face or nod of a head and you know you are all thinking the same thing. ""I love music"".

        Keep your eye out in 2015. Whether it's a violent Hybrid banger or a Psychedelic Trap tune LUZCID is promising to raise bars and reinvent what is thought to be ""traditional"" club music. Peace Love and Tunes.

Maintaining a focus on artist development, the Serkal team has prioritized the releasing of quality music from the best upcoming and well established producers from around the globe . Founded by the NYC based nightlife entrepreneurs behind Sankeys Ibiza Robert Toma and Anthony Piacquadio and under the artistic command of Co-Founders Dave Rosario and Sebastian Oscilla Serkal as a project has been several years in the making. Serkal quickly emerged as a label on many leading DJs’ shortlists due to their unrelenting dedication to the underground niche and it’s next generation artists. Offering listeners an opportunity to purchase releases both digitally and on vinyl, Serkal stands as one of the few contemporary imprints that embraces the methodologies of old school record labels. Promising much more to be unveiled in the near future - which includes three Serkal showcases at Sankeys Ibiza in 2013 with plans to expand shortly after the summer season along with releases from countless international talents - Serkal has surged to the forefront of labels to look out for.

Yes, we understand if you’re sceptical—everyone claims to be a rule-breaker these days. But try putting into words the music on his and Bok Bok’s inimitable Night Slugs label or any of his tracks and remixes over the past few years and it should quickly become apparent that L-Vis 1990 has been doing things just a little bit differently.

James grew up in Brighton, UK, where during his teenage years he began to DJ, produce and promote club nights. He co-founded the Fallout night, while picking up gigs across the city and experimenting with music production software. The booking of NYC producer Drop The Lime for another of his club nights, So Loud!, would prove to be an epiphanic moment, in that it reconnected James with a love for bass music, inspiring him to write his standout first release, the L-Vis 1990 EP.

As though setting in motion a domino effect, the track “Change The Game” from that release piqued the interest of Alex Sushon, AKA Bok Bok, who got in contact with James, thus beginning an enduring creative relationship that would indeed change the game. James relocated to London soon after, although the pair quickly concluded that the city’s music scene was, to quote Alex, “shit and we weren’t feeling it.” The by-product of their vexation was Night Slugs. The first party went down in March 2008 at Camberwell’s Redstar, and went on to take up primary residence at East Village (among many other raves at one-off venues) with guests like Oneman, Lil Silva, Geeneus, Christian Martin, Roska and Kode9 feeding into the night’s freewheeling attitude.

As Night Slugs began to properly establish itself, as did James as a producer. In 2009 Compass / Zahonda for Sound Pellegrino and the colossal United Groove for Mad Decent were supplemented by a slew of remixes for artists like Laidback Luke & Diplo, Riton & Primary 1 and Gucci Vump. Acting as a precursor for all that was to come the following year, James and Alex also dropped The Night Slugs EP through Glasgow imprint Dress 2 Sweat, introducing Alex’s now famed style of artwork and their common interest in eschewing any sort of formulas.

The energy and creativity surrounding the Night Slugs party had reached critical mass by the end of that year: at the start of 2010 the Night Slugs label was launched via Mosca’s Square One. By the time James had made his full NS debut with the anthemic Forever You in August, the imprint had put-out peerless music from Girl Unit, Egyptrixx, Lil Silva and Jam City, and was already being spoken of in terms of ‘label of the year’. A tumultuous first year was encapsulated on Night Slugs Allstars Volume One, while James and the extended NS family had successfully cultivated a vibe and an outlook that was entirely sui genius.

This considerable momentum spilled over into 2011—killer releases from Kingdom, Bok Bok, Pearson Sound and Jam City made sure of that. In the studio, meanwhile, James had begun to further explore the groove-based exploits outlined on “Forever You” and his remix of Gucci Vump, via re-rubs of Cassius and Round Table Knights. In fact, the real result of these endeavours could be thought of as a lifetime in the making as James released his debut album, Neon Dreams, through PMR Records. Using exclusively hardware (Roland’s 707 drum machine features on every track), James has crafted a deeply personal record that, through the voices of Javeon McCarthy and Samantha Lim, conveys the story of a year in his life. Neon Dreams brings 15 years’ worth of musical influences to bear, while shifting into focus the love of classic house music that has transcended all of James’s output to date.

Never one to let the dust settle 2012 see’s James dive further into the House music whirlpool, with an anthemic remix for dance legends Orbital and his first release for NIght Slugs since 2010′s ‘Forever You’. Club Constructions Vol.1 is part of a  a new series of releases that will operate alongside Night Slugs’ main EPs and white label series, a home for their most direct productions, aimed straight for the dancefloor. With CC Vol.1 James draws on classic Dance Mania and Underground Construction vibes to deliver 5 tape-saturated, strictly-analog slices of modern-day ghetto hard house that have been supported by DJ’s across the world of house and techno. 2014 looks set to be the year that James and Night Slugs reaffirm their place at the forefront of progressive club music.",58,

Schwarz Dont Crack’s music is truly inspired by a very pure and original RnB vibe, but given an edgy and modern twist. The songs dodge too much intellectualizing in place of sensuality – airy lyrics flirting with deep, minimalistic yet melodic beats that almost force people to dance along – and that's precisely what Schwarz Dont Crack are aiming for. 

The duo met in 2011 when singer/ songwriter Ahmad Larnes, moved from New York City to Berlin in search of great beats to match his vocal stylings. And in that directory of possibility called Craigslist, he found what he was looking for: the precise, but never overproduced beats of Sebastian Kreis, who had escaped the dullness of village life in Southern Germany to move to Berlin. 

Bonding right away over their mutual love for nineties RnB and sharing a vision for that precise equation of words plus music, they immediately started working on their first track, 'Day By Day', the same day they were introduced. Their debut show as Schwarz Dont Crack followed shortly after at Fete de la Musique in Kreuzberg. Having played over 30 gigs in Berlin at prestigious venues such as Berghain, Arena, and Kantine, in 2013 the duo were given the opportunity to tour with UK artist Jessie Ware and also add some festival experience to their band resumé playing Melt! and Berlin Festival. With enthusiasm building the band had features on various blogs and magazines like Intro, Style.de and Interview Magazine. 

Their first single, 'Charade',was released in October 2012 with Kitsuné Records. The song, a poetic examination of a girl's hidden identity which she only reveals once the sun goes down, is cinematic, haunting with a masterful chorus. Newly signed to Nettwerk Music Group, stay tuned for their EP release in January 2015.",2014-12-28 01:46:16.143247,2015-01-08 18:22:28.847883,,,martin@nettwerk.com,,t,23081,5452656,new york/berlin,,f,,f,Schwarz-Dont-Crack,2671,266710576696106,"After only one year together, Berlin based minimal R'n'B group SCHWARZ DONT CRACK have made a name for themselves among the club crowds of Berlin. Vocalist Ahmad Larnes hails from NYC and producer Sebastian Kreis from south of Germany. Together they move effortlessly though a soundscape of deep bass, 90's drum machines and soulful lyrics.

Music has been his passion at a very young age - learning to play the guitar at the age of nine while taking a big interest in punk rock at the time. Never committed to just one genre, Ian Spurrier maintained the mantra “I was always just listening to new stuff”. This resulted in a new wave of sound combining progressive and electro, with the songcraft of rock and pop. This wide range of sound allows Fareoh to deliver one of the most forward thinking and energetic sets out there. 

The word “prodigy” has been quite a tossed around word in the 21st Century, but this most definitely applies to the young phenomenon known as Fareoh. His rise to substantial fame stemmed from his countless remixes that garnered the attention of even the most seasoned music listeners. Even though he had no formal producing instruction, Fareoh rapidly refined those skills and soon blogs were ablaze with exhilaration for this unknown, upcoming producer. As curiosity continued to grow, Fareoh was catapulted into an ephemeral spotlight when he was hand picked by Kaskade to open for Kaskade’s ‘Freaks of Nature’ Tour in 2013 as well as headlining a massive 30 date bus tour in 2014. Soon thereafter, Fareoh was in high demand to play esteemed venues and called upon prominent stars such as Wynter Gordon, Lady, Gaga, and most recently Birdy for remix duties.

The consistency in quality from his productions has seen him receive support from some of the biggest artists in the scene today, with the likes of Kaskade, Hardwell, and Tiesto already all playing along to the tune of Fareoh.

Continuing to skyrocket in the North American club and festival scene, Fareoh has played some of the United States most revered festivals such as Electric Zoo, Nocturnal Wonderland, and illustrious clubs proving that Fareoh’s history of touring is nothing short of impressive. With new tracks in the ready and an electrifying upcoming tour circuit, Fareoh is showing no signs of slowing down.

Right now, it’s time for this New York native’s sound to meet the rest of the world, and it’s up to Fareoh to spearhead this movement. With the upcoming tour dates spreading all across North America, the rest of the world is soon to get a taste of what this young sensation has in store. This is only just the beginning for Fareoh.

New York City's Shiftee has translated his intuitive math geek mentality into far-reaching success on the turntables, electrifying crowds from NYC to London to Hong Kong. With a degree from Harvard, 2 unique DMC World Champion titles, a NYU adjunct professorship, a top 10 debut release on Beatport's Dubstep charts, a finger on the pulse of bass music, and an ongoing international tour schedule, this overachiever can do it all.

On Sept. 12, 2009, DJ Shiftee represented the USA in the 2009 DMC World DJ Finals. He took the title, was automatically inducted into the DMC DJ Hall of Fame and brought the fabled gold Technics turntables back to NYC! This new title places his name along side over 20+ legendary DMC World Champs including Craze, A-Trak, Cash Money, DJ Cheese, Rock Steady DJs (Apollo, Mix Master Mike & Q-Bert), Plus One of Jack Beats, and the late Grand Master Roc Raida.  In 2007, Shiftee also became the only American DJ to date to have won the DMC Battle for World Supremacy title. This victory served as the catalyst for widespread international recognition, allowing Shiftee to take his talent and creativity across Asia, Europe, and the US to some of the world's biggest clubs, most prestigious venues, and monster festivals.  His groundbreaking DJ mixes have been featured on BBC 1Xtra, Mishka Keep Watch, Kiss 100 (UK), Deepsession, Seclusias' Who Run It!? Podcast, The Rub's Scion AV Show, Dubset, Dubspot, Boundless NY, Noise 212, KNKT3D Magazine, Noisy Dubs, and more.

Having already established himself as master in the DJ world, Shiftee has been gaining momentum as a producer.  His debut release Space Ace, a collaboration with Rx on Rad Summer, hit top 10 on Beatport’s dubstep charts.  His originals and remixes have been receiving support from Rustie (BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix), Royal-T, Udachi, DJ Wonder (Rinse FM), Pictureplane, Dev79, Elijah (Butterz), Mess Kid, Mishka, Mad Decent, Selecta Fewie (Nasty FM), Rx, Sonkin, Lamin Fofana, and more.  With tunes already out on Rad Summer, Deepsession, and LU20 plus forthcoming releases + remixes on Seclusias, Dutty Artz, and Hot Mom USA, Shiftee is definitely a producer to watch.

Shiftee is also a renowned educator in the field of DJing and DJ technology.  He is an adjunct professor at New York University, the Director of DJ Curriculum at the prestigious Dubspot school in NYC, and an endorsed artist & product specialist for Native Instruments.  The man understands DJing!  Beyond teaching, Shiftee spends his time figuring out new and innovative ways to decimate the dancefloor. He fuses an astute ear for cutting edge music with a world champion skill set & grasp of technology, creating an experience that is always jaw dropping.

ALPHAHOUSE, LITTLE HELPERS - USA

Butane has been flying the underground flag, professionally, unapologetically, since 2001 when he began DJing.  There are countless mechanisms ready-built into the electronic music industry which relentlessly pull one toward commercialization, aka selling-out, and he vows to resist them at all costs.  

Through the years, he's watched in disappointment as peers (sometimes understandably) succumb to the pressure, and in doing so, ultimately lose the respect of those who matter most - their colleagues and fans.  Nevertheless, steadfast, through hard work, dedication, and commitment to artistry, he finds himself a pillar in the scene.  This is no accident.  

Owner of two exceptional record labels (Alphahouse & Little Helpers), and responsible for a sprawling and impressive discography of original work and remixes, he forges his own path.  Against the odds, he believes talent, hard work, dedication to craft, attention to detail, and uncompromising belief in these core principles is the way to conduct a meaningful career in the music business.  Because of this, Butane consistently snubs offers promising money in exchange for small pieces of his soul.  Those kinds of things chip away at a man until what remains is unrecognizable.  Instead, he grows, evolves, changes on his own terms.

His rich yet languid style bares all the hallmarks of the classical and compositional training he has had, whilst everything from jazz to blues to trippy electronica inform the New Yorker’s well honed production palette.  

Having emerged on the now landmark Significant Others EP (with his track ‘Fast Tongue’ released by inimitable New York stable Wolf + Lamb in only 2009) he’s gone on to thread sunny melodies and steamy bass lines for More or Less as well as Gadi’s boutique, vinyl-only label Double Standards; Permanent Vacation and more. 

There have been remixes and high-profile covers (Sade’s ‘Sweetest Taboo’) along the way, too, whilst dance floors across the world have all fallen under his charmingly seductive spell. Of course, Wolf + Lamb’s legendary Marcy Hotel is one of those places, and has been since the start, whilst Slow Hands is also resident DJ for boutique NYC promotion and web-zine, Autobrennt.

 “The thinking is to always do something as different and musical as possible” says Ryan of the sounds he has been making – in various forms – since being a child. Aiming to elevate electronic music to wholly new and rewarding creative planes with his approach to writing songs, not tracks, Ryan continues:  “I want my music to be made for all places, and atmospheres.” 

Slow Hands is about emotion, about warmth, about creative freedom. He makes music that gets you thinking and feeling as much as dancing, and also does so alongside friend John Paul Jones (Tom Croose) as Worst Friends, and friend Nick Dalagelis (One of Them) as Male Madame. So, too, will the future see him develop his live set. However you digest him, then, you’ll do so with a smile on your face and a glow in your heart. ",56,NYC

Born in NYC, Craft bought his technics 1200's & Vestax mixer at age 14 with his own life savings in 1994. He taught himself the skill of beat matching and studied the art of blending tracks smoothly to perfection with persistence. He began producing music in 1999 under the name ""Craft"". He performs regularly in the NYC underground techno scene for his established ""Twice as Proper"" techno events and other local showcase events. He evolved from the Vinyl-only days to CDj’s of all types, and now often performs live with his controllers. In 2010, Craft traveled to Europe for his Italy Dj tour to Milan, Rome, and Terracina, then experienced an incredible Costa Rica DJ Tour covered by much media attention (national radio and TV). Craft ended up the year by hosting 8 Twice as Proper events in 5 stunning venues in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. In 2011, Craft performed on the main room at ""The Works"" during Detroit Movement Electronic Music Festival, as well as debuting in Washington DC at Funxion and Sweet Spot clubs, and at Boston’s famous Rise afterhours club as headliner in the main room for 5-hours. He was approached by countless labels for remixes and original EP’s and is now signed on over 25 top labels based in a dozen countries. Craft currently has 9 EP's released and countless remixes and collaborations. In 2012, Craft showcased for ""Cultured Citizens"" event at The Old Miami in Detroit, and performed at an incredible 5 after parties during Detroit's 2012 Movement Festival, including performances at The Works, Belle Isle, Bookie's, TV Bar, and Motor-City Wine. Later in the year, Craft headlined again at The Works for a ""Devolve Detroit"" event. 

2013 performances continued with monthly shows in NYC for his ""Twice as Proper"" events. Live recordings were often featured on relevant techno podcasts from around the world. Craft returned to Detroit for performances at 2 events during the 2013 Movement Electronic Music Festival performing at The Works and The Magic Stick and was later back in Detroit for a large summer stage performance at Sindbad's Marina in July for ""Dirty 313 Productions"" Riverside Groove day festival-style event in front of the APBA Gold Cup hydroplane boat races on the river bordering Canada. Abroad, Craft hosted a ""Twice as Proper"" event in Mexico City at Suburbano basement and plans are in place for several international shows in 2014.

Craft continues to release music on important techno labels and collaborating with major international artists. More original EP's and a slew of remixes scheduled throughout the year and leading to his first full length concept album announced for 2014. 

Craft co-created the NYC techno movement ""Twice as Sweet"" with his partner Shadi in 2007. It was later renamed ""Twice as Proper"" and has reached an impressive over 250 events and counting in the past 6+ years with an illustrious list of over 120 guest DJ bookings. ""Feed The Raver Podcast"" is a techno show founded and hosted and produced by Craft himself with Jenny Arredondo. It debuted worldwide on March 3rd 2012 with notable interviews and bi-monthly guest's techno DJ set from a different city around the world. Feed The Raver was officially featured as a Detroit Movement festival media coverage in 2012 and 2013 interviewing international techno DJ's as well as promoting the festival itself. Craft also created and designed the ""Party People"" T-Shirt trademark in 2008 which has a history of its own....

About Craft's music production software choices: 
Craft first began producing in 1999 with programs such as ReBirth (which emulates two Roland TB-303 synthesizers, a Roland TR-808, and a Roland TR-909 drum machine all at once) and Cakewalk for final arrangements. He then used strictly Reason for five years, from its first version launched in 2000 through version 3 when he finally migrated to Apple’s Logic 7 in 2005. Today he continues to use mainly Logic, which has now reached version X as well as Maschine, Ableton, Reason and other plugins using multiple keyboards and controllers in the studio. Craft taught himself everything and is a true master at using the complicated features of various professional music production software. The results are evident with the continuous smashing releases which have now earned him an international reputation, 14 years in the making..

His debut EP for Symbols (“That Feel”) sees Antonio implementing more organic instrumentation, as well as original vocals, and the finished product is a strong vision of the future of Pop and R&B.

Set apart by his iconoclastic productions, he is regarded as one of today’s most prolific remixers with well over 300 commissioned remixes to date including Katy Perry, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Donna Summer, Santana & Fall Out Boy, and his original production career spans collaborations with such diverse artists as Junkie XL, Deorro, Arthur Baker, Felix da Housecat, The Partysquad, Rebecca & Fiona, Midnight Magic, Glowinthedark, Peaches, Kid Sister, Bart B More, Shinichi Osawa, The Disco Fries, James Murphy, Live City and many more. 

Tommie's often spoken about DJ sets have landed him on the main stage of Ultra Music Festival two years running, the Hard stage at Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas, Australia's Stereosonic, opening for Afrojack at Pier 94 on NYE, playing alongside Skrillex for his Brooklyn ""Takeover"" and an East Coast run of dates opening for Zedd. 

Whether as a producer, DJ, artist, dance music historian or social media provocateur Tommie brings a unique enthusiasm to his craft; one that is fueled by his encyclopedic (if not obsessive) knowledge of underground and pop music spanning the last half-century. This brought him to moderate & sit on panels at Amsterdam Dance Event, South by Southwest, Electronic Music Conference in Sydney Australia, New Music Seminar, Ibiza Music Summit, CMJ, Winter Music Conference and EDMbiz. Sunshine has appeared on Katie Couric's day time talk show Katie, interviewed by Peter Jennings for ABC, appeared on BBC radio & TV, A&E, VH1, NPR and on occasion writes on sites such as Huffington Post known to cause an uproar in his firm stance on many issues most won't dare talk about.",899,"Brooklyn, NY"

As both a producer and DJ, Glasser has shown a willingness to study, reinterpret and re-contextualize disparate sounds, transfixing his skills on a grab bag of genres, ranging from euphoric dancehall to triumphant grime with brief stops to experiment with UK funky, kuduro and Jersey club. A contemporary club shaman, Dubbel Dutch's aim is to inspire transcendence with his 'cosmic tone poems and club anthems from the abyss'.

In 2012, Glasser released the Self Help Riddims EP, his most cohesive, song-focused effort to date. Self Help Riddims signaled a new direction for the Dubbel Dutch sound, marked by breezy, trance-like melodic content within an instrumental dancehall framework. Strangled, pitched-up ragga vocals are set off against elastic, hip-shaking percussion, derived in equal parts from Kingston and London. Situated comfortably around 100 beat-per-minute, the EP pairs nicely with his ""Slow Club Mix"" released several years before. Featuring slowed down edits of Jersey club songs inspired by his former Texas home this work garnered thousands of plays and gave many their first taste of the now ubiquitous genre.

Soon after, Dubbel Dutch let loose the ""Cloud Club Mix"" and, subsequently, the Cloud Club EP, both scene-defining efforts boasting original tunes, collaborations, and VIP edits with contemporaries such as Murlo, Rizzla, and Samo Sound Boy. Unlike the breezy melancholy of Self Help Riddims, Cloud Club is a direct, boisterous affair, a collection of energetic stabs that are impossibly infectious. Overarching pop motifs and Jersey club's rhythmic energy take center stage on ""Left Behind"" and ""Inevitable"", songs that might be Glasser's most club-focused to date. With Cloud Club, a hydra of influences coalesced into a singular aesthetic that is unmistakably organic and unmistakably Dubbel Dutch.

It wasn't long before Glasser's effortless vitality and coherent aesthetic drew the attention of players outside the dance music world. Starting in 2013, he began working with rising Jamaican dancehall star Popcaan and the result is an honorable marriage of Caribbean swagger, virtuoso production quality, and a socially conscious world view. ""Everything Nice"", the first collaboration to emerge from Popcaan's recently released Where We Come From LP has surfaced as a universal pop hit, trumpeting out of car stereos, clubs and block parties the world over. The song elevated Dubbel Dutch to rarified status in the dancehall world and Popcaan has become one of the genre's most successful crossover stars.

Along with ""Everything Nice"", Dubbel Dutch produced four other cuts off of Where We Come From, helping define the contours of an album that has sat near the top of the charts since its release. Exposed to a much larger pop consuming fan-base, Dubbel Dutch has become a sought after contemporary producer and was recently enlisted by Le1f for production on the rap futurist's single ""Boom"".

While his ascendency to the cream of pop music has raised awareness of the Dubbel Dutch brand to exciting new levels, don't expect him to abandon his humble club beginnings. Never one to feel comfortable in a single lane, Glasser has stayed busy producing for others, cultivating his many side-projects/aliases for Los Angeles based label Body High, and taking on eclectic remix duties. He’s currently working towards a debut full-length album set for a 2015 release.

All in all, Dubbel Dutch has situated himself neatly at the cross-roads of forward-thinking club music, Jamaican dancehall culture, and American pop music consciousness. With a massive, still bubbling single, an extended portfolio of euphoric solo material, and a growing stockpile of club munitions, the coming years look bright for this dance music polyglot.",73,"Brooklyn, New York"

After meeting at The New School in New York City, Ben “B-Roc” Ruttner and James “JPatt” Patterson both found themselves in need of a place to live. The two moved in together, and quickly set about making their neighbors hate them. “Our apartment was this small, shitty Avenue C apartment with paper thin walls. We both had studio set-ups in our rooms,” explains B-Roc. “It would be loud as hell, and the neighbors hated it. They’d knock on the walls and bang on the ceiling. We would go into each other’s rooms and say ‘I just got the knocks.’”

Declared by the NME as one of the “20 hottest producers in music” as “cred-pop’s answer to the Neptunes” by The Guardian - they are now one of the most buzzed-about duos on the electronic circuit. JPatt’s background in soul and funk and B-Roc’s years spent immersed in trip-hop and hip-hop beats has allowed them to quickly ascend the production ranks. Initially gaining recognition for their remixes for artists including Haim, Santigold, Foster the People, Two Door Cinema, Ellie Goulding, Chiddy Bang,Passion Pit and The 1975, they eventually found themselves experimenting with sounds of their own.
 B-Roc and JPatt didn’t think much would come of a nearly five-minute track they had been building, all tense beats and tingling synths. “It kind of started out as a joke,” says B-Roc. “But people were liking that more than the stuff we produced for other people,” says B-Roc. “It felt right.” The duo quickly discovered a newfound freedom in creating their own songs. “It's better because it's ours, and we can do whatever we want with it,” explains JPatt.  
When The Knocks realized the chord they’d struck, they opened their own custom-built studio Heavy Roc Music on the Lower East Side in New York City. Over the past three years, the duo has been jet-setting around the globe for DJ gigs, sharing stages with Grouplove, M.I.A., Two Door Cinema Club, Dragonette, Sleigh Bells, Chromeo and chrome… all while releasing infectious singles that have turned The Knocks into blog darlings. After releasing “Dancing with the DJ” in 2010 via Heavy Roc , the song shot to #1 on Hype Machine and hit #1 on Japan’s Electronic Songs Chart, with heavy rotation at JJJ. 

After the success of their Comfortable EP, they have now released the chilled-banger 'Classic' on Neon Gold and Big Beat.

Be prepared, because The Knocks will be knocking at your door and stereo very soon.",623,New York City

Heidi is a self-taught musician and vocalist exploring the genre of “New Weird America”. Her creative practice is based on an exploration and intermingling of traditional and non-traditional sound sources. 

BANNER ARTWORK BY: Eta
http://etadormesuipescivolanti.blogspot.com/

Repertoire of instruments include piano, clarinet, harmonica, guitar, melodica, synthesizer, theremin, and various sound makers. She contributed many of these sounds as well as songwriting as a former member of the chamber folk trio http://soundcloud.com/cutleri, later in http://soundcloud.com/knife-throwers-assistance,  an eclectic musical collective based in NYC and continues to collaborate in her band: https://soundcloud.com/heidiandthe9feathers But Heidi’s first “instrument” was her own voice. From a young age she performed lead roles in operettas and musicals, and although stylistically she has moved on to more avant-garde territories, the quality and range of her voice still hinges on her theatrical roots.

Heidi attended the Institute of Audio Research in New York City, focusing on the process of recording and producing, and went on to record several self-released albums in her home studio, Suki Sound. Her work has been reviewed by labels and blogs all over the globe, applauding her as a unique and exceptionally prolific songwriter and recording artist.

With a style based on his diverse tastes, Eli subversively drops his influences and personal favorites into even the most commercial of sets.  Anyone who knows anything about dance music knows Eli Escobar, and if you don’t you will.

Eli grew up in 1980’s New York City.  His love for hip-hop brought him his first set of turntables and he became a connoisseur of vinyl records very early on, building his collection and expanding his knowledge of the music that moves people.  He spent much of the Nineties in the New York club scene, going to parties and eventually being the reason others went.  By 1999 he’d produced his first string of hip-hop 12 inches, which was only the beginning of his broadening musical aspirations.

Over the past several years, Eli has turned to remixing, transitioning smoothly to what he does best – dance music.  His talent as a remixer is reflected in the wide range of artists who have sought him out to turn their songs into something specifically his.  The list boasts work for Diplo, M.I.A., Britney Spears, Chromeo, Holy Ghost!, Pase Rock, and Amanda Blank, whose debut album featured two Escobar-produced tracks.  Miss Blank was also featured on Eli’s EP,  Love Thing.

As his name has grown among artists, so has his influence.  In 2007 he launched the ever-popular blog, outsidebroadcast.com, very simply demonstrating not only his love for dance music but his dedication to finding it, and ultimately sharing it. Through this outlet, Eli has become a source that DJs pay attention to, often presenting new or forgotten gems, remixes, re-edits and of course free DJ mixes, often accompanied by Eli’s insightful commentary which gives context to the music he shares, ultimately offering a great read as well as listen.

With the release of his first full length solo album, as of now untitled, we as listeners have his finely tuned ear constructing what will certainly be a certifiable classic.  What Eli brings to the table in his production, through the looking glass of his career is an understanding of music’s sustainability.  Eli strives to enhance people’s experience with music wholly – through playing out, his blog, the remixes and now full circle by producing his album.   It’s a natural progression that has seen Eli’s following steadily grow, with heightened anticipation for what’s next.",32,"New York, New York"

Being brought up around the soulful synths of Electronic music, it was only natural that their production remain on the same path. Under the alias “Ponchoz”, Michael took his stance as a DJ in 2008 at New York City’s well known club, “Europa” while David polished his technique behind the boards. A year later, Michael was reinvented as the “Classic Local Favorite” we know and love, Droid Beats. Unfortunately, due to educational obligations, David was unable to take part in the success that Michael was gaining. While David offered feedback, concepts and moral support from afar, Michael took the helm and worked tirelessly to bring notoriety to the act.

Now as the full act they had intended to be, they're working hard to make their mark in the Dance Music Industry. Remixing, producing, mash-ups, bootlegs, it's a constant cycle for them. This ethic has allowed them to release music on well-known labels such as: Funky Element Records, Peakhour Music, Intermission LTD, Metronix Recordings, Caffeine Music Group, and Golden Needle Records. Working directly with artist like Filo & Peri, George Acosta, Micro, Exodus, Devin Martin, X-Dream and more, the amount of time and heart that Michael and David put in is evident. With their Funky Element releases, “It’s Over” and ""Elektro Bros,"" Droid Beats broke into Beatport’s Electro House Top 100 Chart. And that was just the warm up round.

As of now, their talent, passion and knowledge for production in Electro, Tech-House, Dubstep, and Trance continues to grow and they have shared their ability to rock the dance floor on line-ups with artists such as: Showtek, Designer Drugs, Charles Feelgood, Frankie Bones, Lady Faith, Dara and Dank just to name a few. Their mixing, producing, and live performance continues to be top notch. Filled with electric vibes, genre bending filthy grooves, teasing break downs, pleasing drops and non-stop screaming that will guarantee the name will not be forgotten.",15,"New York, New York"

It is through a combination of hard work, perseverance, skill and the adulation of his fans that Amadeus is creating the classic American tale and storming up the world DJ chart.

Amadeus began his career in NYC strictly as a DJ during the Golden Age of clubbing in the 90s. It didn’t take long for his unmistakable “big room” sound to receive recognition. Amadeus started making a name for himself playing weekly for 5000+ people at some of the hottest clubs in NYC at the time including Tunnel, Limelight, Webster Hall, Mansion (M2 Ultralounge) and Pink Elephant. After 10 years of DJing, Amadeus took his musical skills into the studio. The result: a full-on assault of successful hands in the air club anthems including “Burn” featuring Blake, “I Miss You” featuring Amuka and “Flashdance…What A Feeling” a massive chart topping classic remake produced with partner Richard Grey. His tracks have been featured on various Pacha and Ego CD compilations including ""Adult Entertainment with James Vevers Red 09"", ""Pacha - The World's Favorite Club (Summer 2010)"", ""Pacha Ibiza VIP Vol. 6"" and “Ego In Cote D’Azur 2013” and has been recognized by DJ Mag’s prestigious Top 100 list two year in a row.

As Amadeus’ productions grow in popularity this year with some of the world’s biggest DJs, so does his touring schedule. The renowned DJ and stellar producer has taken his act on the road, playing his newest productions all over the globe with regular stops in the United States, Canada, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. He has performed alongside some of the biggest names in EDM such as Tiesto, Swedish House Mafia, Kaskade, Paul Oakenfold, Bob Sinclar, Sharam, Roger Sanchez, Danny Tenaglia, Christopher Lawrence, Offer Nissim, Peter Rauhofer, Behrouz, Richard Grey, Tieschwarz, Nadia Ali, Donald Glaude, Yahel, Redroche, and Serge Devant. With this kind of support, expect to see this classic in the making achieve great things in the near future.

You would be hard pushed to find a more passionate, more in-demand and exceptionally talented local NYC artist, regarded highly by his peers and fans in the metro area.

Mir’s progressive sound does not hold back on power. Deep, sultry, and moving, Mir’s mixes create the perfect catalyst to intoxicate a crowd, whether he’s on warm-up, peak-time, or closing duties. Mir’s sound draws influence from dance music legends, including Paul van Dyk, Solarstone, Airwave, and a slew of other trance and progressive artists that brag the uninhibited vivacity of high quality dance music in its prime; the way it was, before the era of uber-compressed, electro- clichéd, bastardized dance music.

 Dynamic, driven, and drastically obsessed with performing as well as he can, Mir is no stranger to the club scene. Having played numerous shows in NYC, New Jersey, Boston and Pittsburgh, he knows how to churn the dancefloor’s energy and create an enjoyable musical journey. Additionally, he has shared the decks with some of the world’s most renowned artists, including Eco, Sneijder, Andy Moor, Roger Shah, Thomas Datt, to name a few, and soon alongside Mental Asylum artists Indecent Noise, Matt Bowdidge and Jase Thirwall.

Mir has completed noteworthy remixes for Zedd’s hit single, “Spectrum”, as well as Kyau & Albert’s “Another Time”, which has amassed live support from Ronski Speed. His mashups have received tremendous support from producers across the board, with a big thumbs up from Kearnage label boss Bryan Kearney. His latest work includes a remix of Monoverse’s single, “Kheira”, which is set for release on Infrasonic Recordings soon. His passion for music is too strong for one simple generic association, and right now, his message is louder than ever.

You can subscribe for free to Mir’s podcast on Itunes here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mir-omars-podcast/id829278555

12 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT DAVID DIMUZIO...

1. I wrote my first real song when I was 11 years old because I had a huge crush on a girl at camp. My heroes growing up where my favorite musicians, and that seemed to be what they did. I sang her the song after we attended the ""summer camp dance"" then timidly asked if I could kiss her, she said yes, and then we kissed each other on the cheek ...I realized I was on to something. ...Most of the other big decisions I've made in life since have revolved around girls.

2. I'm a selectatarian (I eat things other than vegetables, but I somewhat carefully selct them). I mostly eat fresh fruits, veggies, and lean meats (no pork or shellfish). I don't smoke, rarely drink, and I LOVE hot teas!

3. Love your neighbor as yourself, but love your siblings even more. They're your biggest connection to the past, and most likely people to still be there for you in the future. The best free gift I ever received were my four brothers and my sister. 

4. My favorite singer is Billy Joel and my favorite band is Bon Jovi. I want to write songs like Billy Joel...and look like Jon Bon Jovi.

5. I believe in people. I think it's better to naively trust and get hurt or disappointed sometimes than to constantly keep ones guard up. 

6. I slept in my car for two years ...fortunately never because I had to, but because there's a certain amount of freedom that comes with knowing you can live out of your car. I still remain a minimalist, and everything I own can still fit in a station wagon. 

7. I've traveled to 77 countries.

8. I love making videos! ...music videos, blog videos, how to videos ...etc. and I'm proud (and flattered) that my videos on YouTube to date have been viewed over 35 million times.

9. When I was 16 I won the International Jugglers Association 'World Championships"". Juggling and competing in the World Championships gave me something tangible that I could hold on to throughout a rough childhood. I liked the fact that with enough work I could ""defy gravity"".

10. I've never owned a TV. I love to read.

11. My favorite quote is currently ""Make your life a story worth telling."" - Adam Braun.

12. I write my own lyrics and produce all of my own music. I've also written songs recorded by a lot of talented Filipino artists such as Yeng Constantino, Rhap Salazar, Nyoy Volante, Mark Bautista, Top Suzara (Freestyle), Geneva Cruz, Arnee Hidalgo, Mikey Bustos, Steven Silva, & Yassi Pressman.",2014-12-25 04:40:48.303723,2015-01-06 21:19:18.970011,,,info@daviddimuzio.com,,f,5383,1151225,new york city,,f,,f,daviddimuzio,,,,,

Born in Mt. Vernon, NY, she began her love of music at a very young age singing in a church choir.  By the time she was 16, she moved to New York City and began taking dance lessons at Broadway Dance Center, where she studied all forms of dance including hip-hop, house, jazz, and ballet.
 
While music had taken a complete hold over the young Devyn, it wouldn’t be until years later that she was discovered by multi-platinum producer Dame Grease during a BMI Open Mic. As her journey was destined to take its own unique path, Devyn’s first introduction to the entertainment world on a professional level was as a model, where she participated in several local and national fashion shows. Fully aware that singing was her biggest passion, in her spare time Devyn began originally writing songs and recording under the name of Tanya aka T6. With the connections she made in the fashion world, she began performing at fashion shows, which eventually lead to her performing at different venues and competitions.  
 
Under her previous moniker Tanya T6, she released a mixtape for fans, entitled “Move Over Paris Hilton, There’s a New It Girl in Town”, hosted by New York’s POWER 105.1’s DJ Suss One”. From the mixtape, she released “Work My Body” which premiered on the DJ Wrexx show on WZMX Hartford's Hot 93.7 and quickly flooded the digital world, which led to calls and request from across the nation and the globe. Stemming from the momentum that she had created with her first single, she began remixing popular songs and  sending them out via a weekly email blast to all the major DJ’s across the world. Before long, DJ’s began contacting her on a daily basis requesting her latest and greatest remixes which eventually helped brand her as the “The Remix Queen”. To follow, she released her official follow-up single entitled “Get It Off” featuring Young Money’s  Jae Millz, which hit radio airwaves nationally and internationally, adding to her having over 30 songs tracked and accumulating radio spins.
 
Over the last few years, she has been working diligently to perfect a sound that she is thrilled to call “her own”. Having been fortunate enough to work behind the scenes with Hip-Hop artists such as 3 6 Mafia, N.O.R.E., KURUPT, Mims, Jae Millz, French Montana, Chinx Drugz, Max B, Mike Shore, Royce Da 59, and Grammy nominated Producer D-Moet, she has been able to develop an eccentric new generation mix of pop, r&b, alternative, and hip hop genres.  Her new style signifies edgy, sexy with an attitude, beat driven and loud, which has evolved into the Devyn Rose sound.   It’s a sound that she not only feels passionate about, but also feels that her fans will be able to most connect with.

In December 2014, Devyn’s single “Falling 4 U” debuted at #2 on Billboard’s Hot Singles Sales Chart. While considered by some to be a seasoned veteran in the entertainment industry, Devyn remains both humble and hungry, to share her many talents with the world. When it comes to her music, her career, and her effortless talent, she continues to prove to the world with every endeavor, that she’s destined to be a musical force to be reckoned with.",2014-12-30 00:39:23.370422,2015-01-06 21:19:19.038837,,,dakota@pinkstaircase.com,,f,10304,1026064,new york,,f,,f,Devyn-Rose,,,,,

Nacido en República Dominicana y criado en el Bronx, NY, Latín Grammy's nominado, Sensato, ha revolucionado el sonido Urbano Latino al que todos nos hemos acostumbrado. Este lyricista tiene la habilidad de pintar un cuadro con sus palabras, llenar una pista de baile y provocar pensamientos dentro de sus oyentes. Sensato siendo rapero underground llamó la atención de muchos con su video de su tema ""Mis Hijos."" El video de ""Mis Hijos demuestra su creatividad, versatilidad y estilo único de rap de Sensato. Después de muchos años que trabajo independientemente la liberación de Sensato fue ""Watagatapitusberry"" la canción se convirtió en una sensación viral. La aceptación mundial inmediata de este ""Fenómeno Berry"" despertó la atención de los artistas Pitbull y Lil Jon que decidieron unir sus fuerzas para formar parte del remix oficial de esta canción y el video histórico. Sensato hizo su introducción en agosto del 2009 con su gran éxito ""Watagatapitusberry"", que alcanzó el número 4 en los Billboard Latín Rhythm América Tropical y gráfico como el Top 50 Hot Latín Song. Esto resultó en una invitación para que Sensato cantara ""Watagatapitusberry"", junto a Pitbull en ""Premios Juventud"" del 2010. Pitbull sigue siendo mentor y expone al joven artista a muchas de las maravillas que la música tiene para ofrecer, y le ha dado el privilegio de viajar y cantar con él en el ""2012 Planet Pit World Tour"" en Canadá y América Latina. También han colaborado en varias canciones incluyendo ""Latinos en Paris"" y ""Crazy People"" ft Sak Noel que termino siendo parte del número de apertura de los Premios Billboard 2012. ""Crazy People"" se ha convertido en una sensación internacional y le ganó a Sensato su primera nominación en los Latín Grammy's. No sólo fue nominado para su primer Grammy, pero también tuvo el honor de ser el cierre de los 2012 Latín Grammys. Sensato ha estado trabajando diligentemente en un nuevo álbum, ""We Ain't Even Supposed 2B Here"" que esta por salir en el 2014 debajo del sello discográfico de Pitbull, Mr. 305 Inc.",2014-12-28 01:46:16.216295,2015-01-06 21:19:19.448977,,,sensatodrops@gmail.com,,f,6570,1755079,new york,,f,,f,Sensato-Del-Patio,,,,,

514,Matt Sucich,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000102165508-snput1-large.jpg,"Matt Sucich spent 2014 writing, performing, and recording the follow up to his self-produced 2012 full-length 'Layers.' His band was also there. So was producer & engineer Paul Loren. Together they released a single, 'The Lonely Dreamer,' and as 2015 unfolds, new live video sessions and studio-recorded, live-to-tape, honest-to-goodness American tracks will be yours to see and hear via magic internet services.

Sucich (pron: Sue-Sitch), from Queens, NY has appeared at Willie Nelson's Heartbreaker Banquet in Austin, TX (2014), Firefly Music Festival in Dover, DE. (2013), Newport Folk in Newport, RI (a private event for NPR Music with The Lone Bellow, 2013), Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, TN(2012), and Levon Helm's Midnight Ramble in Woodstock, NY(2009) as well as many other extraordinary stages. 

Matt has supported & shared the stage with headline acts including, but not limited to, Levon Helm, Adam Duritz & Counting Crows, Lucius, Rachael Yamagata, The Lone Bellow, Hunter Hayes, Daughtry, and Lewis Watson.

In 2013, Matt co-created the ongoing ""Downtown Comes Uptown"" series with Lincoln Center's David Rubenstein Atrium & Rockwood Music Hall. Hosted by WFUV 90.7, it's inaugural performance included Sucich, Rachael Yamagata, Lake Street Dive, and Akie Bermiss with Lynette Williams, and has since seen performances by Aoife O'Donovan, Elle King, The Spring Standars, & Emily King.

Here are some nice things people have said: 

“Because this Queens singer-songwriter is trying to break your heart. What appear at first glance to be simple love songs quickly reveal a Wilco- and Iron & Wine-like depth (and desperation).”  - Andy Langer, KGSR Austin & Esquire Magazine 

""Equal parts Lord Huron, Paul Simon, & M. Ward, Sucich establishes his own voice on the playful, island flavored, 'The Lonely Dreamer.'"" -Bruce Warren, WXPN Philadelphia

""Whenever he's on stage, Matt Sucich strikes a balance between light-hearted, straightforward humor and profound, evocative lyrics. He's a storyteller with the ability to turn a string of metaphors and similes into images and ideas that linger long after the song ends."" - Pam Segura, Pancakes & Whiskey

""His refined croons lamented lost lovers and contained the kind of wisdom that all singer-songwriters strive towards. I felt disappointed at the end; not because it was unsatisfying but because I didn't want it to end."" - John McGovern, Deli Mag

""He doesn't follow typical pop-style songwriting, rather goes off the beaten path and tells his stories over unique chord progressions and key changes. His range goes from soft and slow to a playful Paul Simon style in songs like 'The Lonely Dreamer' and 'House of Cards.' Think of a one-man version of The Head & The Heart."" -Tom Shackleford, Pancakes & Whiskey

From djing parties since 1997 to producing since 2001, Hoogs is no rookie in drum and bass.  

Loving every style of drum and bass, Hoogs shows great versatility in his productions and dj performances.  He produces and mixes a variation of styles from jump up and jungle to deep and minimal.

Hoogs has set a high standard for quality in his production; and has been on an upward progression towards his goal of becoming a highly respected drum and bass producer.  His recent productions have been gaining him a lot of attention from djs, producers, label owners, and enthusiasts.

With the world we live in now, with our ever changing culture, we find there is so much to explore so why sleep. Were too busy engaging in our daily life, only to fade away our nightlife, but every so often we stop to smell the roses. We feel it coming as the brink of innovation is near, we hear the tall tales, we experience the next level, and we see the next big thing happen every so often in our very own NYC. With that said, if it's not obvious enough, the cities next big thing is right in front of your eyes....
 
In early 2011 two artist [David & Jordan] joined together in creating the alias ""Phunk Kings"". David with a background in Tribal & Tech House, and Jordan with a background in Progressive & Minimal House, the fusion of sounds was like no other. Initally the focus was to create different tracks, not just one style but all styles. For about a year of Bootlegs, Remix's, Mashups, & Originals the goal was to find out what their sound was. Testing different methods, trying differnt collaorations, as the year of 2012 came to close, Phunk Kings had made quite a stir, having already been supported by the likes of Laidback Luke, Thomas Gold, & even Roger Sanchez. It didnt take long for the duo to realize they need to reinvent them selves, not just a new alias but a new brand. After a month or so in brainstorming, they stumbled upon some rare analog gear that was quite outdated. Almost 20 to 30 peices of hardware lying around the studio, primarly due to the fact that Jordan's dad had once been a DJ/Producer himself. Although the gear was junk and unusable, it still made sense to have it around the studio for inspiration. Furthermore, having produced, remixed, & mashed up everything digitally and idea clicked. And so DIGITAL JUNKIEZ was born.
 
Kickstarting the new alias on January 1st of 2013 the duo knew what they wanted to acheive, and they were keen on accomplshing thier goals. This time the focus had been Quality not Quantity. After Months in the studio, countless Bootlegs, Mashup's, & Edit's the level was raising. As the fall had come the fun had started. Early September of 2013 the duo signed a new Single ""Let's Go' with PEAK HOUR MUSIC. As the focus was Quality not Quantity, the Duo's first ever orginal release had been supported by the likes of Mattise & Sadko, Axwell, Ferry Corsten, Nari & Milani, and many more. Following up to that they debuted a brand new collaboration with Pacific based DJ/Producer Jason Ross on Mr. JoeySuki's imprint DUBBED RECORDS. Which Managed to get the support of legends such as Eddie Halliwell him self. But they didnt stop there, to close of the year they had a couple records they wated to give out for free, as a token for the amazing support they have gotten this past year. On the 25th of December they release a Free Remix to One Republic - If I lose Myself, which got picked up by Kryder, aswell as a timeless remix to The Temper Traps - Sweet Dispositon which has been supported by non other then Thomas Gold.
 
2014 is here, and this duo is one to watch. As they are the cities next best thing! ",123,New York

BIO:
When you talk about young, talented, up and coming latin/urban deejays from New York City, the name Dj Supreme doesn't fail to be mentioned. At the age of just twenty four, he's already one of the top young deejays of this new generation.

His parents emigrated to the states from the Dominican Republic in the late 1980's. Joel ""DJ Supreme"" Severino was born and raised in New York City. From a really young age he was enamored with music. By the time he was a teenager, he developed an interest in becoming a deejay. As a freshman in college he started deejaying local house parties. Soon after he began deejaying in top New York City nightclubs; bringing a new refreshing style and vibe to the New York City nightlife.

In early 2012, Dj Supreme began working for Spanish Broadcasting System, the home to the number one latin radio station in the world, La Mega 97.9 FM. He began as an intern in their promotions department. In just a short year, he was privileged enough to deejay live on-air broadcast's for special events and nightclubs.

Thanks to his hard work and dedication, in less than two years at SBS La Mega 97.9FM, DJ Supreme is the official on-air deejay and musical producer for New York City's number one afternoon radio show ""El Jukeo"". Dj Supreme is also the youngest on-air deejay on La Mega 97.9. The sky is the limit on his future and promising career.

As a teenager, Jesse, heavily influenced by his parents’ vast record collection, began to fuse rock, punk, soul, and funk with the hip-hop of his generation. “My parents musical tastes really shaped mine. My first cassette was Led Zeppelin and my second was Sam Cooke.” 

Jesse’s encyclopedic knowledge of music and remarkable skill have since taken him around the globe headlining college tours, appearing at festivals, and holding residencies at premiere venues worldwide including LIV (Miami), Lure and Supperclub (Los Angeles), MIXX (Atlantic City), Finale (New York), KKC (Frankfurt), and Kaufleuten (Zurich). Jesse has become a favorite of the fashion and art worlds playing high-profile events for Alexander Wang, Giorgio Armani, Calvin Klein, Vivienne Westwood, Donna Karan, Diesel, GQ, and Kaws. Of his choice to hire Jesse to deejay his Milan Fashion Week runway show, Tom Ford said Jesse’s “musical taste reminds me of my childhood.”

Jesse’s 2013 single, “Superstar” on Glassnote Records follows a string of acclaimed official remixes for Two Door Cinema Club, Kings of Leon, Childish Gambino, Peter Bjorn & John, The Knocks, and his 2012 single “Daddy Cool” [Big Beat / Atlantic Records] which spent weeks on Beatport House chart. Jesse recently lent his expertise to Stussy and Visionaire curating exclusive mixes and compilations. Of his widely hailed Stussy Mix, one dance blog wrote, ""[This mix] feels like a definitive statement regarding what Jesse‘s about. You get cuts from DJ Shadow’s first album, throwback jungle cuts, and a grip of things we can’t easily define. It’s like he took a lifetime’s worth of his favorite tunes and threw them into a 90 minute opus. And it bangs. Seamlessly. You won’t find a better mix than this today, or tomorrow."" Jesse frequently collaborates with hip-hop superstar Kid Cudi with whom he has performed around the world including at Rock The Bells and on Jimmy Kimmel Live!

His 2012 was highlighted by the College Dropouts Tour, on which he and nightlife photographer Kirill Was Here crashed the ten best college parties in America, headlining the Fall ClASHic Tour alongside Asher Roth, performing with Kid Cudi at Rock The Bells, and an eleven-city Vice Magazine-sponsored tour with Pusha-T and Machine Gun Kelly to promote the blockbuster film Project X in which Jesse had a staring role. 

Jesse has modeled for Marc Jacobs, Uniqlo, Converse, and Stussy. He has been featured in Vanity Fair, GQ, Vibe, Complex, Us Weekly, In Touch, The New York Post, Dancing Astronaut, Gotta Dance Dirty, This Is 50, Good Music All Day, and This Song Is Sick. ",181,NYC

“Though his mission is serious, AWKWORD’s got a quicksilver wit that permeates most of his tracks… Stay on his good side; it’s a pretty inspiring place to be.” — MTV OurStage

“Awkword’s career is going straight up, so check him out now so you can say you knew him ‘before before.’” — HipHopDX Music Editor Kathy Iandoli

Rapper, Activist and Sociologist AWKWORD is “one of the most impactful and globally active Hip Hop personalities in the game today” (The Hype Magazine) and one of Rap Genius‘s “favorite up-and-comers” — making “quality music that deserves to be heard” (Chuck D of Public Enemy). AWKWORD is also the heart and soul of World View, the first-ever 100% For-Charity Global Hip Hop Album, which The Source has called ”a work of art, embodying true lyrical skill and the empowerment of Hip Hop’s culture.” Sponsored by The DJ Booth (DJBooth) and The Morgan Stanley Foundation, the album is designed to connect us worldwide through Hip Hop culture and rap music. World View features contributions from 35+ producers, representing 16 countries across every continent, and 65+ guest emcees, including Joell Ortiz, Sean Price, Chino XL, KRS-One, Slug (of Atmosphere), Jadakiss, The Kid Daytona, ILL BILL, Jasiri X and REKS. The album is available now at djbooth.it/wrldvw and AWKWORD.bandcamp.com/album/World-View. The bonus disc can be found at djbooth.it/wvbonus and AWKWORD.bandcamp.com/album/World-View-Bonus-Disc.

For AWKWORD, this is nothing new. Today he fights for change through music; his activism began in childhood, with the guidance of his mother (RIP). AWKWORD created his high school’s first (now annual) Diversity Day with the Anti-Defamation League. While earning his Bachelor’s in Sociology from Vassar, he founded the school’s Prison Reform Group, lobbied New York State Congress for the repeal of the Rockefeller Drug Laws and worked or volunteered at Green Haven maximum-security prison, an alternative-to-incarceration center, a probation office and an at-risk youth center.

From AWKWORD’s World View project, all proceeds are donated to Guns 4 Cameras, a 501c3-registered nonprofit that goes beyond the gun-exchange, working to eradicate street violence through the Hip Hop-inspired education and empowerment of the youth in our communities.

AWKWORD has been featured and/or raved about by top news and progressive sources, the leading Hip Hop sites, major on-demand TV outlets and trendsetting DJs on satellite, FM and the Web, including, but not limited to: The Village Voice, Huffington Post, MSNBC’s The Grio, The Nation, Daily Kos and Mr. Davey D’s Hip Hop And Politics; Complex, Prefix Mag, XXL, The Source, VIBE, Hot 97, MTV, Rap Genius, Vlad TV, Urb, The Fader, AllHipHop, HipHopDX, HotNewHipHop, HipHopSince1987, Coast 2 Coast Mixtapes, The Smoking Section, Okay Player, Hip Hop Wired, Nah Right, 2DopeBoyz and DJBooth; Radio Dispatch with John & Molly Knefel, …ANDYOUDON’TSTOP!

As a small child, little Luke enjoyed drooling and eating carrots. However, as he grew Luke knew he had to find his calling. His search for destiny eventually led him to discover…DANCE MUSIC.

Immediately entranced by the pulsating rhythms of this new art form, Luke decided to devote his life to making phat beats. He trained tirelessly under numerous bald-headed mentors in order to hone his production skills. Luke then took to DJ'ing in the hallways of his school, in the basements of friend's houses; anywhere he could to improve his performance techniques. After using his sick DJ'ing skills to win his high-school talent show, Mr. Duke knew he was on the right track.

After graduating high school, Da Duke started making serious moves. He linked up with LessThan3.com, and landed an opening slot at Ultra Music Festival 2012. After killing it thoroughly in Miami, Luke stayed on his grind and brought his infectious Moombahton/Dubstep sound to other venues around the USA, like the Velvet Lounge in Washington DC, the Middle East in Cambridge Massachusetts, and the Electric Warehouse in Brooklyn, NYC. He consistently wows crowds with his high-energy performances, sublime track selection, and funky dance moves. Luke’s music has been broadcast on BBC Radio 1 Xtra, and has been supported by a wide variety of DJ’s ranging from trap connoisseurs like gLAdiator and Bro Safari, to dubstep dons like Reid Speed and Dodge & Fuski.

The future is looking bright for young Luke...",44,"Boston, MA"

Art Direction / Graphic Design / Music Production
contact: id303@hotmail.com

Ivo received his first influences from his family, particularly his grandparents who were descendants from Yugoslavia and Italy, who immigrated to Peru to discover new exotic places and ways of life.  Ivo Draganac Macchiavello, was born in Lima, Peru and became involved in the Latin culture, where electronic music and design weren’t well developed at the time in the 80's. His involvement grew and he benefited from the strong creativity of those early years and from the influences of an ancient culture. Now he lives in NYC, USA.

In 1984 he discovered his first musical inspiration ‘Front 242’ along with other German and Belgian music producers.  He started with a mini sampler keyboard and so his deep knowledge of contemporary electronic music started.  Fascinated by the music, ivo decided to produce many tracks and remixes.  His formal profession is Art Direction and Graphic Design and also has a Masters degree in 3d and multimedia. His early design experiences were advocated to produce the first 3D flyer designs in Lima, Peru for the discos Mamut and Blue Buddha.  They were the first places to focus on electronic music in Lima back in the 90's.

Ivo is a nature traveler that loves to discover new places and experiences.  Later on, Ivo moved his life to USA, were he has lived since 2001. He has continued to broaden his creative pursuits and has been inspired with his trips to Paris, France and Brussels, Belgium.

Passionate with art, design and innovation he uses these two tendencies vigorously within his music and design with his trademarks ID DESIGN © & ID MUSIC ©. He has developed different facets of design: Illustration, Printed Design, Multimedia, 3D Animation, Photography and Clothing Design.

His music is focuses on the style of electro, melodic and space electronics.  His first experiments mixed industrial rhythms with dance feelings and high BPM's.  He has created remixes in tribute to bands like Front 242 on tracks like: ""Operating Tracks"", ""Masterhit"", ""Headhunter"" & ""Until Death"".  He made the flyer and T-shirt designs for the last USA tour for the Belgian Band Front 242. He recently did a remix for the Belgian Band ""Implant"" with the track ""Don't Feed the Robots"".  The CD sold worldwide under the Belgian music label Alfa Matrix.

He produced part of the first and second CDs of the band Arian 1:

His beats are powered by high tension rhythms, where only sensitive listeners will be able to define a scheme of understanding & harmony.  ID Music is a window open for all people who are looking for dynamic beats.

BIO

Furgersen7 Also known as F7BEATS is a Boston, Massachusetts native and is currently living and making music around New York. F7 started making more serious music while in college.

""I enjoyed chopping up video and editing films, so beats came very naturally for me. My first beat was horrible...I thought it was the shit, I was in middle school, I believed. I used my moms computer with fruityLoops, she thought it was some virus because I had so many files, so funny how things grow... If your liking my tracks and want to work, I am always looking for opportunities to create. Send me some of your music, etc. Tell me what you think of my tracks, likes...dislike, suggestions. Thanks to everyone who listens, and shares and enjoys the music. Music is about evoking emotion and reaching people who would other wise be known as strangers. If you listen to my music know that your not a stranger anymore. If my music can evoke emotion it's all love, no matter what.""

A Moment’s Worth consists of five long-time friends from the Bronx, NY who share an insatiable drive to write, create, and perform their own music. Since 2004, A Moment’s Worth has inspired their tightly-knit fans with their tremendous energy, passion, and thoughtful lyrics. Past album releases include Ironic Last Words (2004), A Moment’s Worth (2007), and Sleepless EP (2008). With each successive album release, AMW’s growth and evolution as artists are evident. The band owes their maturity and depth in musicianship to their own hard work, as AMW carefully crafts, records, and produces each song, aided by the production talents of their very own guitarist, Nicola Terzulli. 

START WHERE YOU ARE, A Moment’s Worth’s most recent release, testifies to the band’s artistic maturation. The album is infused with a heartfelt motif: be true to your inner voice and, most importantly, don’t let past hardships stop you from dreaming--use them to propel you forward. Start Where You Are’s track “Push” embodies this message. Its tempo, which mimics a quick-paced heartbeat, is incredibly apropos, as the lead singer, Alex Bondarev, draws on deeply personal, poignant memories from his childhood. Despite the wounds of his past, he does not take the present for granted, for he realizes that his “roads led to this moment,” face to face with the things he loves most: the people in his life, his music, and his fans. The sincerity of AMW’s “Push” and the album’s overall theme is contagious, inspiring and encouraging fans to follow their own intuition and go where their hearts lead them. 

The unique sound of Start Where You Are is the product not only of this unprecedented, wide-open window into the lives of AMW’s band members, but also of the incredible amount of teamwork that went into the album. Over the course of many sleepless nights, the band weaved into their songs the guest vocals, mandolins, and other musical additions that their friends and fans provided. The end result exceeded all of AMW’s hopes and expectations; their unrestrained lyrics and inventive beats work together to create a musical autobiography that is representative of their journey as a band thus far.

To each member, being in a Moment’s Worth is much more than just being in a band. For them, the most rewarding experience is playing to a crowd that knows and sings the lyrics AMW has poured their time, lives, and hearts into. Hearing their fans’ voices echo off the walls heartens and reassures the band that their messages, living in the present and appreciating life to the fullest, resonate with listeners. A Moment’s Worth reminds us of the limitless importance of accepting and knowing ourselves through and through. 

A Moment’s worth is Alex Bondarev, Anthony Albanese, Frank Quarto, Johnny Endico, and Nicola Terzulli.",2014-12-30 22:07:09.532068,2015-01-06 21:19:20.301797,,,band@amomentsworth.com,,f,395,2311684,new york,,f,,f,amomentsworth,,,,,

Blunder is a 21-year-old hip-hop emcee born and raised in the suburbs of Upstate New York. Known to his family and friends as Colin Flanders, he's what you would call the ""idealist's realist."" No dream's too big....and no thoughts are too real. He captures moments in time, locking them away for safe keeping until the right music comes along to transform those memories into the nostalgic, hip-hop roots mixed with new school soundscape he delivers. Since the days of zoning out on the school bus with rhythms flowing out of his walkman, to releasing his first mixtape back in 2012, he’s been obsessed with the pursuit of perfect verses and neck-breaking hooks. To date, Blunder has released two full length, successful projects as well as a multitude of highly acclaimed singles. With plans for his debut album slated for a late 2014 release, Blunder has his goals picked out and his vision in clear view. After beating cancer in 2013, he now has his sights set on a different battle: finding his place amongst hip-hop’s most respected and influential artists.

Spinning and curating music for over nine years to an array of swank lounges, night-clubs and corporate clients plus traveling as far as Italy, India and Hong Kong to share her potent musical perspective.

Hailing from Trinidad and growing up in Brooklyn New York, Tasha recalls always being deeply impressed by music. Some of her earliest music education moments came via browsing the 45’s record collections of her uncles and helping them spin at family functions. Though music was among her first loves, Tasha for many years pursued her career in Acting and Education. But the passion for DJing lingered and in 2001 Tasha launched into her DJ career with fervor.

Tasha has since worked with many night-clubs, promoters and DJ luminaries. Notable venues include Cielo, Water Taxi Beach, Hudson Hotel, Hotel on Rivington, Sullivan Room, APT, Greenhouse, Ganesvoort Park, Crobar Chicago and NY, She has also directed music for corporate clients like Vogue Magazine, Veuve Cliquot, Swarovski, Citibank, Donna Karan, Levi’s, Deisel and others. In 2010 Tasha produced an original score for a national video campaign for the XOXO label. Tasha plays in DJ festivals around the world, most recently, The Winter Music Conference, Electric Zoo and Mi Casa in Mexico. Tasha has a monthly session on Austin based Internet radio channel, FreekRadio . Tasha has served as sound designer for MCC theater and the Barefoot Theater Company. Tasha also has several independent movies and commercials under her belt and serves as a teaching artist in the NYC school system
Blending a mix of syncopated, melodic house music inspired by Latin American, Middle Eastern, African and other global sounds, her sets are eclectic and reflect the influence of hip-hop, funk, afrobeat, soul, jungle, techno, reggae and even booty bass. From the lounge to the dance floor, the combined musical collection and skills that this DJ brings are incomparable.

Damitio began recording music in middle school and quickly became entrenched in the process of home recording. Hundreds of songs were recorded through genre bending projects such as Disney Fever, Glorious, GFU, Rock Strongo, Conspectro, Andrew’s Band, ROBOTRIP, Animal Instincts and more. The various albums and demos quickly began their circulation through CD-Rs throughout Damitio’s high school and college career and thus Animal Testing Records was formed as a means to distribute these home recordings.

His passion for music however began at the age of 12 when a growing interest in music, and more specifically sound, began to develop for Anthony Desiderio. He first dabbled in a few musical instruments including the piano, drums and guitar. Nothing, however, could come close to satiating his appetite quite like the turntables.

Desiderio realized his passion lied in the full package – producing, playing and performing. The turntables brought this passion to life, and he couldn’t get enough. As his curiosity piqued, his skills began to flourish and, at the age of 21, DJ Ah Yeahh was born. Understanding the industry’s ADD-like nature, Ah Yeahh doesn’t limit himself to just one style, he finds a natural ability to transcend and speak to the masses through hip-hop, rock, top 40, Electro-House, and R&B. This makes Ah Yeahh a standout in a cluster of mainstream MacBook DJ’s and producers in the US.

His work and gifted ability to create unique sound has afforded Ah Yeahh the opportunity to work with some of the most recognizable faces in the business including Flo Rida, Benny Benassi, Victor Calderone, Clinton Sparks, Pitbull, Ying Yang Twins, DJ Khaled, Shop Boyz, Killer Mike and corporations including Nike, Liquid Lighting and LA Fitness. Aside from his evolving turntable skills, Ah Yeahh continues to reinvent his image and looks to the likes of DJ AM and A Trak as his biggest influencers. Recognizing the need to diversify his portfolio, DJ Ah Yeahh is capitalizing on opportunities in production since moving to Brooklyn in early 2011. Most recently he is applying his knowledge to help upstart the AMG DJ Academy in the NY/NJ tri-state area to grow the industry and teach people of all ages how to scratch records.

DJ Ah Yeahh speaks four languages fluently (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and English), is a neat freak, loves technology and sees himself staying in this business until he’s an “old man” having traveled the world as a DJ force to have been reckoned with. “I believe that to do what you love is the secret to being happy. Everything else comes second,” DJ Ah Yeahh explains. After listening to his music, you will understand why.",0,New York

The 22-year-old part-Mexican, part-French digital native world citizen (now living in Paris, but previously in NY, Mexico DF, London and Buenos Aires), ANDREA BALENCY was spotted in 2010 as one of the most promising and exciting musical presences in the Mexican art-rock scene and singled out by James Blake (R&S, Universal), Inc. (4AD), Au Revoir Simone (Moshi Moshi) and Mount Kimbie (Warp), among others, as a supporting act. In April 2013 she was chosen by The Cure to open the closing gig of their worldwide tour in the main Mexico DF stadium ""Foro Sol” for 50.000 people.

She played SXSW and Sonar before settling in Paris to start working on a new EP, WALLS, an eclectic mix of elegant hooks and soul-tinged indie electronica released on the 23rd of June 2014.

Having recently collaborated with avant-garde US and UK-based producers like Nick Hook & Los Angeles electro wunderkind Salva, she secretly supplied lead vocals on James Blake's collaborator Airhead’s critically acclaimed single “Autumn”. Following a standout collaboration with New York based rapper Kilo Kish and with former Young Turks act We Are Shining’s new track co-written by FKA Twigs due to be released, Andrea sheds her high-brow classical piano training, blue-eyed English soul and both French and South American folk inspirations to plunge into washes of expansive electronica and dreamy, suggestive vocal textures in her solo project.

File Andrea’s ethereal deep soul dubstep sounds and her fairy-like unique voice next to AlunaGeorge, FKA Twigs, Little Dragon, The XX & SBTRKT and you will not regret it. Currently writing her first album, Andrea Balency is a hauntingly beautiful singer you don’t want to mess with. It’s time to let you go.

&#13;
Blake first joined the music industry at the early age of 6 years old. Blake's first instruments included the drums and percussion. From that point on, Blake has played and mastered such instruments including the horns, the guitar, bass guitar, keyboards/the piano, the strings, etc.&#13;
&#13;
Blake joined his first Rock Band at the age of 16 and soon fell in love with the limelight of large audiences. Blake's love of electronic music first started in the late 80's early 90's and it covered everything from Depeche mode to Nine Inch Nails. Unfortunately Blake took a break from music for 7 or so years for a dead end relationship but once the relationship ended, Blake then re-entered the spotlight as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist for 2 bands, one rock band and one electronic rock band that Blake had formed.&#13;
&#13;
After Blake formed lumps on his vocal chords he decided to step away from the band scene and started working with electronic music. Producing well known remixes and tracks for major artists.&#13;
&#13;
From Falling off of stages to crowdsurfing dolphins to bringing the CRAZIEST atmospheres to his shows.

Born in NYC, Craft bought his technics 1200's & Vestax mixer at age 14 with his own life savings in 1994. He taught himself the skill of beat matching and studied the art of blending tracks smoothly to perfection with persistence. He began producing music in 1999 under the name ""Craft"". He performs regularly in the NYC underground techno scene for his established ""Twice as Proper"" techno events and international showcase events and festivals. He evolved from the Vinyl-only days to CDj’s of all types, and now often performs with live layers of effects with his controllers. 

In 2010, Craft traveled to Europe for his Italy Dj tour to Milan, Rome, and Terracina, then experienced an incredible Costa Rica DJ Tour covered by much media attention (national radio and TV) and hosted 8 Twice as Proper events in 5 stunning venues of Playa del Carmen, Mexico. 

In 2011, Craft performed on the main room at ""The Works"" during Detroit Movement Electronic Music Festival, as well as debuting in Washington DC at Funxion and Sweet Spot clubs, and at Boston’s famous Rise afterhours club as headliner in the main room for 5-hours. He was approached by countless labels for remixes and original EP’s and is now signed on over 25 top labels based in a dozen countries. Craft currently has 10 EP's released and countless remixes and collaborations. 

In 2012, Craft showcased for ""Cultured Citizens"" event at The Old Miami in Detroit, and performed at 5 official afterparty events during Detroit's 2012 Movement Festival, including performances at The Works, Belle Isle, Bookie's, TV Bar, and Motor-City Wine. Later in the year, Craft headlined again at The Works for a ""Devolve Detroit"" event. 

2013 performances continued with monthly shows in NYC for his ""Twice as Proper"" events. Live recordings were often featured on relevant techno podcasts from around the world. Craft returned to Detroit for performances at 2 events during the 2013 Movement Electronic Music Festival performing at The Works and The Magic Stick and was back in Detroit for a large summer stage performance at Sindbad's Marina in July for ""Dirty 313 Productions"" Riverside Groove day festival-style event held in front of the APBA Gold Cup hydroplane boat races on the river bordering Canada. Abroad, Craft hosted a ""Twice as Proper"" event in Mexico City at Suburbano basement.

In 2014, Craft performed at the Electric Planet Music Festival in Toluca, Mexico and hosted several Twice as Proper events in Mexico City at Rioma Club and Celestina. He performed at a spaceship stage event in Dallas hosted by ""Source 20/20"". Other US performances include shows in Detroit during the 2014 Movement festival at Bang Tech 12 hosted by Detroit Techno Miliitia, ""Sensory"" event in Washington DC and Twice as Proper events in Brooklyn at Olivia and 407 Bushwick as well as Sankeys NYC debut. Europe album tour in July 2014 with shows confirmed at NWR showcase in Amsterdam, Circeo Summer Beat Festival and more.

Craft continues to release music on important techno labels and collaborating with major international artists. More original EP's and a slew of remixes scheduled throughout the year and leading to his first full length concept album on Aerotropic label in June 2014. 

Craft co-created the NYC techno movement ""Twice as Sweet"" with his partner Shadi in 2007. It was later renamed ""Twice as Proper"" and has reached over 250 events and counting in the past 7+ years with an illustrious list of over 120 guest DJ bookings. ""Feed The Raver Podcast"" is a techno show founded and hosted and produced by Craft himself with Jenny Arredondo. It debuted in March 2012 with notable interviews and bi-monthly guest's techno DJ set from a different city around the world. Detroit Movement festival officially includes Feed The Raver media coverage in 2012, 2013 and 2014 interviewing international techno DJ's as well as promoting the festival itself. Craft also created and designed the ""Party People"" T-Shirt trademark in 2008 which has a history of its own....

About Craft's music production software choices: 
Craft first began producing in 1999 with programs such as ReBirth (which emulates two Roland TB-303 synthesizers, a Roland TR-808, and a Roland TR-909 drum machine all at once) and Cakewalk for final arrangements. He then used strictly Reason for five years, from its first version launched in 2000 through version 3 when he finally migrated to Apple’s Logic 7 in 2005. Today he continues to use mainly Logic, which has now reached version X as well as Maschine, Ableton, Reason and other plugins using multiple keyboards and controllers in the studio. Craft taught himself everything and is a true master at using the complicated features of various professional music production software. The results are evident with the continuous smashing releases which have now earned him an international reputation, 15 years in the making..

Despite growing up in a musical home and developing a deep understanding of the craft from his uncle - a skilled disco deejay - Mel never had visions of spinning records. While studying abroad in Japan, however, he began collecting records and reluctantly agreed to deejay a friend's birthday party. Now, years later, Mel'­s meteoric rise in the DJ sphere speaks for itself.

Called upon to play in nightclubs and entertain at private and corporate parties around the globe, Mel has won critical acclaim for his technical skill, but he insists his success stems from something more personal. ""I make sure my personality comes across in my performances. The personal connection with the audience is not only what I enjoy most about deejaying, it's also the reason I keep the dance floor full.""

Mel has been featured in a breadth of publications including Forbes, In Touch, Us Weekly, OK! Magazine, Complex, Vice, BlackBook, New York Daily News, and Time Out New York.",2015-01-03 20:40:54.471534,2015-01-06 21:19:22.260775,,,mel@meldebarge.com,,f,479,1660342,new york city,,f,,f,Mel-DeBarge,,,,,

Introducing Disco Killerz, the NYC based DJ production duo of Matthew Danger & The French. 

The pair first collaborated when The French was a member of ""Ghost Stars"", who released successful tracks with Perfecto Records and Spinning Records as well as received support from Diplo and radio play on BBC. 

Their sound combines driving electro house grooves and big room progressive melodies, with a touch of funky groove on top of a catchy pop sensibility. With their roots in indie rock, songwriting, and virtuoso keyboard and guitar playing, the merger of the influences creates an original sonic palate that plays well in a variety of formats and crosses genres. 

Their first tracks to be released will feature ingenue vocalist Hannah and violinist Sarah Charness. The pair are currently working on a slate of releases for 2015 and a series of select performance dates.",2015-01-03 21:03:46.149431,2015-01-06 21:19:22.428853,,,discokillerz@gmail.com,,f,28,55418843,new york,,f,,f,Disco-Killerz,,,,,

While Brian always had a natural knack for rhythms and tones, it was the art of dance music that really drew him in as a way of combining his multiple musical quirks in to a coherent, artistic medium.

Brian used to sneak away from his other commitments in Atlanta, Georgia to reach down to the suburbs of his youth and play various underground parties. Honing the art over the course of a year and a half at the tutelage of peer Aaron Robinson, Brian learned what makes parties work.

Met in 2004, Mark Snyder (also known as Remark) was a big force in Brian's evolving music world. Known for playing at the legendary Firestone club in Orlando, and for playing with the likes of Chris Fortier and DJ Icey in various Florida highlights, Mark was the perfect tutor to foster a love of dance and encourage a wide range of musical selection. Mark and Brian put together a mix CD for Brian's birthday in 2003, cementing a friendship that was definitively aural; the release was called Shock, and was met with much enthusiasm from the Atlanta community. It sold at both Brushstrokes and Outwrite stores.

While researching the origins of dance's explosion in to US music, Brian began searching out whitelabels faster than his friends could provide. Brian took to purchasing large quantities of ""bargain bin deals"" at Satellite Records in the Little Five Points District of Atlanta, and at EDs Records in nearby Midtown Atlanta. Brian collected tracks that many of his DJ peers at the time didn't even know the relevance of, including Xpander and Heaven Scent. While Brian poured over the Global Underground back catalogue and Sander Kleinenberg's idea of music-as-a-story, his peers continued to provide new, fresh house music in the form of monthly releases. Brian's love of musical niches had him routinely camped out at Club Jungle, The Heretic, and 1150 in an attempt to hear the latest and greatest beats.

Brian has instigated many a groove at various Atlanta venues, including the Eagle, The Mark Ultralounge, and club 1150. Brian has also performed for years at the Burning Man festival with Camp Astropups, and has played out in San Francisco for the Burning Man Official Christmas Party, The Burning Man Volunteer Resource Event, the House of Shields bar, Club Shine, and Club Dirty. Brian also produces ambient tracks on the side, and has included them on various releases in the past. Brian has also hosted ""learn to DJ"" workshops as art events on the Playa.

While releasing steady podcasts since 2005, Brian has always had the listener in focus when designing his musical soundscapes. The podcasts are designed to take the average music fan from a lower energy point to one of higher ecstacy. To do this, Brian crafts a believable story that he understands one will want to listen to, again and again, to build their energy levels to new heights.

Brian also believes in including artists and mashups that people are familiar with to keep them engaged and excited.

You can find Brian's full catalogue of podcasts at his website: www.djbrianmaier.com. You can email him your feedback at djbrianmaier at gmail dot com.",117,"San Francisco, CA"

567,Nick van Tiel,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000022440932-bgmk2c-large.jpg,"Nick van Tiel is a talented DJ and music producer who splits his time between the sun-drenched beaches of Sydney, Australia, and the raw streets of New York City.
 
Raised in New Zealand on a diet of soul, reggae and hip-hop, it was inevitable that Nick's musical taste would be shaped by the land of his birth.  A decade spent between Sydney, London and New York has exposed Nick to a vast array of musical ideas which have all contributed to his unique style - fusing elements of hip-hop, reggae, dancehall, house, and UK bass into an infectious melting pot of soul music.

Just as comfortable providing the soundtrack to a sublime night of cocktail indulgence as he is making a dancefloor sweat, Nick's genre-defying love for all things soulful has earned him residencies and headline appearances at a number of the world’s most illustrious venues, as well as numerous festival appearances, fashion shows and product launches across the globe. 

His production work with longtime DJ partner Skygro, as @Housing-Corp, has earned Nick serious street cred in the house and bass music scene, and the pair’s monthly underground parties have become a staple of New York City nightlife. With strong support from a large number of music blogs and DJ’s, the boys work is getting them some real attention and they have a slew of originals and remixes slated for release in the coming months. 

Playing alongside innovative tastemakers such as Yolanda Be Cool, The Deep, Slowhands, Le Youth, The Knocks, Claptone, Wave Racer, Nancy Whang, Bag Raiders, Cassian, Mick Boogie, Anna Lunoe, and Flight Facilities, Nick is making serious waves and has also been asked to open for several international heavyweights including Grandmaster Flash, Chromeo, Soul II Soul, Coolio, Crazy Penis, Norman Jay and Aloe Blacc. 

Nick’s ear for music and innovative approach to DJing has led him to become one of the world’s most in-demand performers. Expect to hear big things from this antipodean export in the very near future.

586,Bianca Linta,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000082284786-hvql11-large.jpg,"Booking: info@biancalinta.com

Singer, Songwriter, DJ, Producer. Bianca Linta, a Romanian transplant now making waves across the United States can best described as the “Futuristic Jeanne d'Arc” of DJs and EDM vocalists. She attacks the silence of the night like a sainted, but seductive, “holy spear wielding” biblical heroine from an ancient book found in alternate-reality EDM mythos. After hearing and feeling her music, no matter how things are going in life, you’ll know you’ve experienced something like the birth of a star; you’ll know you have LIVED! Bianca feels: “Without music I would be nonexistent. Music is Nirvana to me and I want everyone to go on this journey with me!”

Born in Resita, Romania, then moved to New York City at 17 years old. She absorbed everything musical once it entered her radar. “I wanted to be part of music, so I trained to be a singer, but I started realizing my love for it was much more than that; I pictured my music being a channel driving people to take action! To awareness! Inspiring people to take chances! Help them escape fear and be who they are! Help them realize how great they are!” Bianca Linta’s passion took over and she began to train at Scratch Academy under DJs like DJ Esquire. She immersed herself into the EDM world by seeking out apprenticeships with DJs like Erik Floyd, Chachi and Rick Wonder. Today her musical influences include artists like: DVBBS, Showtek, Martin Garrix, Alesso, Botnek.

Faced with a harsh world where love seemed to be just an illusion and where compassion seemed something out of a sci-fi movie, Bianca discovered her purpose. Her electro house performance set, is all about happiness, about greatness, about love for humankind, and pure inspiration! “Music comforts the soul, and for that to happen it needs to be real, it needs to come from the artist’s soul itself—my life now is about giving my fans EVERYTHING that sits inside my soul, and sharing that with them freely.""
Ms. Linta has played all over the world from clubs & festivals in her native Romania, around the world, and has become a mainstay in NYC and Miami spots like: The Jane Hotel, FIFTY Miami, SL Miami, Goldbar, Le Bain, Cameo, and countless underground warehouse shows. She's performed at world-famous parties like Ibiza's SupermartXe, and shared stages with established heavy-hitters like MYNC, Max Vangeli, Crystal Waters, Bro Safari, MakJ, DVBBS, Gareth Emery, The Crystal Method, etc. She’s a relentless EDM force—driving & bangin’ beats into your DNA like she invented the genre herself!

“I’m a Love Supremacist!” Linta is on a divine mission to radiate and vibe “Peace” all over the universe. So rally the troops, your new, melodically inspired leader is HERE!... Empowered by the EDM gods themselves—if you want to destroy the “ordinary and evil” of the galaxy, put Bianca behind the One & Two’s… you’ll simply be killin’ them with the harmonious light of Love, Happiness & Inspiration. Join her million fan battalion, vibrating like screaming lasers aimed at every planet to rock the ground fans across time & space are dancing on.

594,djsubjectenglish,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000102671006-av9ub0-large.jpg," Inspired by the sounds of New York City clubs that he frequented such as Limelight, Sound Factory and the Tunnel, Chris”Subject”English was driven to DJ and produce house and techno music. Hearing New York City’s legendary DJ’s Danny Tenaglia and Junior Vasquez play their deep and dark sounds fueled the fire within him to buy his first pair of Technics 1200 turntables and the desire to produce underground music. He would soon incorporate his love for that dark underground sound in his production and his live DJ sets. Since then Chris has played at various clubs in Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York City and Atlanta. Having a good ear for that kind of underground sound made it possible for him to create some of his most popular tracks like; “I Want My Drums” featuring Phil Angelo on vocals, “Torture”, “Sustained”, and his dark tribal tech remix of Leland McWilliams’ track, “Shango”. Chris has released his original productions and remixes on various labels such as Kult Recordings, Quanza Records, and Coraza Recordings to name a few. He also was part of a collaboration project called Beatlevel which released tracks on TKC music as well as Peter Presta’s Apple Jaxx Recordings. Most recently, Chris released ""Corner of the Room"" a hypnotyzing techno track which is out now on legendary DJ/Producer Carlos Manaca's Magna Recordings. Chris is also a part of the very talented 69 Muzic roster and has a new EP release on the 69 Muzic record label coming out soon.  Whether it be one of his live DJ sets or his original productions and remixes there are many more great things to come from Chris”Subject”English

Growing up in New York exposed him to a plethora of eclectic sounds. The early influence of music and nightlife in Dalton's life led him to buy his first turntables and begin DJing at the young age of 15. Since then Dalton has expanded his talents to production, bringing his progressive sound to big rooms and festivals around the world. Most notably, Dalton has spun EDM festivals such as Life in Color on Governor's Island, Electro Beach in Puerto Vallarta, and Winter Music Conference in Miami while holding residencies at high-profile clubs including Lavo NYC, Marquee NYC, Estate Boston, Wall Miami, Opera DC, HQ AC, and many more.

Egor began to develop an interest in the work of DJ`s. Soon, he began to practice and learn from his friends, concerts, videos, and various computer software. 

His first steps started off with Fruity Loops, Pioneer Pro DJ software, and more. With random sets consisting of house and trance music, he made his first six sets within a year for his family and friends.
 
In 2007 with a great and fast ability to learn, Egor grew up fast with his step brother and decided that advertising and promoting was enough and it was time to move on.

He believed and saw that those were the best months of a new beginning. With many visits to Clubs in Europe and throughout New York City, with experience he developed his own taste and style.

Growing up in the diverse streets of New York City, JR. recalls walking in his neighborhood and hearing music and rhythms from all over the world. While he listened to Aventura and Merengue Típico at home, he also listened to artists like Kanye West, Justin Timberlake, and John Mayer. It’s no wonder his music today resonates a rhythmic fusion of Latino pop, electro-beats and soul.

JR.’s songs echo an innocence yet seductive storytelling that provokes nostalgia and excitement, romance and reality, all at the same time. His sound is original, smooth, sonic, and sexy. His suave vocals complement an array of percussive rhythms and bass that will surely have the masses turning up the volume and hitting the dance floor. Under music label 848 Enterprises and Bisono Management Company, JR. is about to explode into the Latin music scene and showcase the next generation of pop music",2015-01-04 02:27:25.928245,2015-01-06 21:19:23.255227,,,wbisono@gmail.com,,f,476,24876043,new york,,f,,f,Jrismusic,,,,,

The New York City based chanteuse speaks French, Spanish, Czech, Portuguese and Italian, but her most fluent communication skills are through music.

Dubinsky’s music encompasses the sultriness of bossa nova, the longing of soul, the vulnerability of folk, and the earthy sophistication of jazz. The polyglot chanteuse sings in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, and has been favorably compared to Sade, Portishead, Brazilian Girls, and Joni Mitchell.  French Culture Guides named her “Best Up and Coming Francophone Singer in NYC.” Her songs have been featured on MTV, Lifetime and Animal Planet, ads for American Express, Radio Imagen stations throughout Mexico, National Public Radio, and her new song, “Wait For You” won the Sennheiser recording contest at the 2012 ASCAP EXPO.  Eleanor's releases include Touch The Sky (2011) and Listen To The Music (2012) and are available on iTunes, Amazon and major online music stores.

DJ Nature/Natureboy Began releasing music on his own ""Ruff Disco""
records back in 1990 in NYC. Due to his job as record buyer for a
Japanese store at that time he became acquainted with most of the new
york based record labels that were popular then, such as Nu Groove,
Easy Street, Elegal , Emotive etc etc . Also having linked up with Ray
Barney of Barney's distribution of Chicago around the same time, he
was fortunate to have access to a lot of the great music of this genre
around that time also. His work also demanded him to frequent the clubs
and record stores of that era such as vinylmania, 
downtown records, dance tracks, and clubs such as Better Days ,Choice,
Sound Factory,shelter, Save the robots, Red Zone,Zanzibar etc.  to hear
legendary DJ’s Larry Levan, Louie Vega, or Tony Humphries etc. After
setting up his own small label (Ruff Disco records ) his tracks were
licensed to  Black Label NYC (a subsidiary of Elegal records) and
Tomato Records U.K with the Ruff Disco E.P Vol 1  and Necessary
Ruffness Vol 1 & 2. Around 1992 Natureboy stopped production on the
project and re-started again in 2010 through Phil South's ""Golf
Channel recordings"" (NYC) and Jazzy Sport (Japan) under the name
Dj.Nature . Using the remnants of unreleased material from 1992 he
shopped the tracks to the labels and followed those with various other
releases.
HIs major inspiration comes from people such as Patrick Adams, the Chic Organisation, Hamilton Bohannon,Ashford and Simpson,Wilbert Longmire, The Crusaders, The Young Senators, Crown Heights Affair and the Fatback band to name a few who had a big impact as his first musical encounters in a club atmosphere. Later the production of the legends such as Armando. Larry Heard,Joe R Lewis, Farley, Poindexter ,Dj Pierre,Adonis, Gene Hunt, Todd Terry would further motivate him into the world of production. Later the likes of Masters at work,wayne gardener, the Basement boys,Mark Kinchen (MK) and Kerri Chandler. Biggest inspiration from a dj Stand point comes from Tony Humphries and local Bristol dj Seymour.

Native New Yorker, Mitchell Ulitsky, also known as Mitchell Frederick, has had a life long passion for music. His musical upbringing began as a child, where he discovered his love of music through playing many musical instruments such as the trombone, piano, guitar, and bass. At the ripe age of 14, Mitchell began to draw upon his musical talents as well as his inspirations in order to turn his passion into something more tangible: becoming a DJ. After about a year of practicing everyday on his first DJ setup, Mitchell finally decided that he was ready to take on the night clubs. Over the years, Mitchell Frederick has played at countless venues all over New York and South Florida. He has made many trips back and forth between New York and Florida to spread his love for music to the masses.

Mitchell has a passion for producing tracks that help give his sets a very unique energy. Always being ahead of the game with the newest music out and knowing what the crowd wants to hear before they hear it are special abilities that set Mitchell apart from the others. His sets are always full of surpirses because he makes many of his own edits and mash ups that he doesn't release to the public. Some of his inspirations growing up were Chus and Ceballos, Oscar G, Carl Cox, Kaskade, and Erick Morillo just to name a few. His inspirations come from a wide range of genres and styles, which make his sets so distinct and diverse.

From the early days in the basement, with the many hours of open, free-for-all jamming, the band slowly gained their own identity and expanded their cumulative influences above and beyond the hard rock heroes they set out to emulate. More extreme and underground groups such as Isis, Sleep, Electric Wizard, Yob, Neurosis, and Esoteric were finding their way into the speakers and headphones of the band. Also, at once having an appreciation for that slower, sludge-filled pit that is Doom Metal, the band were drawn into the hypnotic voids of psychedelia created by the likes of Pink Floyd, The Doors, Dead Meadow, and Hawkwind. These elements have earned them the opportunity to share the stage and perform with the likes of Yob, Acid King, Black Cobra, Clutch, Totimoshi, High On Fire, and many, many more.
	While many genre labels have been lain upon Sleestak, the one that the band embraces the most is “progressive doom”. This seems fitting as the group continually strives to push their creative limits, be forward in thinking, and ignoring current trends even within their own chosen genre. This became evident with the 2011 release of The Fall Of Altrusia. An epic concept album, Sleestak here were found to embrace and combine all aspects of their beloved influences and became a turning point for the band,  now gaining praise and critical acclaim, letting them be seen and heard amidst the smoke-choked sea of their peers.
	What the future brings is still a psychedelic vision shrouded in mist, unclear in its scope or purpose, but the path has been found and the journey has begun…

When it comes to being a pure-bred DJ, there are few who match J-Smoke’s accomplishments behind the turntables. Respected as one of the most skilled all-around DJs in the global DJ community, this New York native brings the best of many worlds to the turntables as a seasoned veteran in the international DJ battle circuit. Coming up as a founding member of the prestigious DJ collective, the Allies, along with DJs A-Trak (DJ for Kanye West & 5-time world champion DJ), Craze (3-time world champion DJ), and DJ turned hip hop super-producer, Develop, J-Smoke and company made DJ history forming one of the most dominant and influential DJ groups to ever hit the international DJ stage.

After achieving a record-breaking amount of world titles with the Allies (the most ever in DJ history), and performing all over the globe with the crew, outside of the group, J-Smoke focused on fine tuning his craft as a DJ to cater his talents to a broader audience.

Applying his world championship winning DJ skills of scratching and beat-juggling to his now signature live DJ sets and critically acclaimed mixtapes, J-Smoke started making his name recognizable in other avenues in the DJ scene. To his merit, J-Smoke's weekly residency party in the Lower East Side section of New York City, went on to be voted ""best music"" in many local publications. In addition, his mixtapes went on to win numerous mixtape contests, demonstrating the diversity of his talent, and validating him as one of the most well-rounded DJs in DJ world.

These are just the few credentials that made J-Smoke's reputation one that has earned him opportunities to open up for some of the nation's biggest acts including Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, Nas, Jadakiss, Kanye West, and Slick Rick.

ABOUT THE ALLIES

The Allies crew is comprised of DJs J-Smoke, A-Trak, Craze, Klever, Infamous, Spictakular, and Develop. As a collective, the Allies hold over 14 World Championship titles-- more than any other DJ crew in the world. With such an extensive resume, the Allies have broken the tradition of the DJ playing the background and have now stepped in to the spotlight appearing on various television networks such as CNN, MTV, BET, FOX, NBC, and almost all of the major and local magazines and newspapers. The Allies are also working hard to change the standard of being a turntablist. They emphasize all aspects of the DJ such as beat juggling, scratching, body tricks and mixing into their live shows as well as mixtapes, LP's, EP's, battle records, and videos that are available worldwide.

Her love of music evolved into running fan forums for bands both domestically and internationally.

Barbara is proud to work with both Indie Artists and Established Acts in all genre's of music, but specializing in Dance Music.   She also is  also happy to be supporting and promoting music for record labels listed above, and having those labels be part of Sobel Nation.


Barbara has several radio stations forming the Sobel Nation network.   Sobel Nation Radio located at www.sobelnationradio.fm, where her artists are featured as well as DJ mix shows.   

In August 2010, Barbara started her own record label, Sobel Nation Records, showcasing ""The Best Of The Best"" artists. She released in collaboration with ISV Entertainment a Christmas Charity CD ""Keep Christmas With You"" featuring the Sobel Allstars, and has several releases lined up for 2012 from Funk3d, Firedance, Eric Dodge, Rosie Romero and many others.

She treats each group individually, always keeping the performer’s vision at the heart of the campaign. Through her expert promotion the groups she has worked with have achieved great success, topping the music charts and gaining international airplay.

I believe music is so important in people lives. Music is one of the ways we make sense of our lives, one of the ways in which we express feelings when we have no words, a way for us to understand things with our hearts when we cannot with our minds.

“Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” - Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias

Since 2009, HULK has walked the earth.  Four long years of audio-conquest, leaving in his wake a scorched land of shattered teeth, broken hearts and ecstasy.  Warlord and alchemist, warrior and poet, HULK has delivered unto the people the truth of sound and forever branded his name into the annals of dubstep.

As the sun sets on his victorious back and the world grows dark, HULK’s gaze falls on those lands yet unconquered.  

He has raged under numerous banners: Rottun Records, SubHuman Records and HULK’s own label, BroTown Records, making him a mercenary monster, a pitiless beast without faction, who delights only in the ripe joy of bass.

His righteousness of rage has been vindicated by some of the genre’s biggest names and beyond:  Modestep, Excision, Dieselboy, Swishahouse and iwrestledabearonce to name just who have worked alongside HULK.  With the reputation of a solid collaborator, 2013 will provide no relief - A huge remix for Public Enemy is impending.

2013 will also bring an unavoidable monthly podcast of fresh and current music, new releases on the BroTown label, and brand new HULK and BroTown merchandise to clothe the huddled masses.

HULK will also demonstrate a warlord’s generosity this year by launching monthly music giveaways with his, “Fresh Fry-Daze”, starting off with an all HULK produced live mix.

Run.  Cower.  Embrace the inevitable.  Whatever you do, HULK cannot, will not be stopped as he marches his new lineup in an endless, bass driven precession across the world.

With being surrounded by Deutsche techno, Renaissance is no stranger to the EDM scene.

Excitingly enough, Renaissance was crowned five times within Beatport's Top DJ charts.Upon releasing his first few singles, such as ""Soulmate"" & ""Be Afraid"", Renaissance soon became a huge hitter in creating a wide variety of music.With recognition in the Electronic Dance Scene, Renaissance has been in high demand since, among a number of NYC's hottest venues.When DJ Renaissance is spinning in any given event, he always creates an amazingly unforgettable atmosphere, with an attracted crowd yearning for more.

He has gained phenomenal experience with Jamaica’s #1 sound Renaissance which has been around for over 20 years.

Playing at all top notch parties in Jamaica is one thing, but they also created rhythms for international superstar Sean Paul and the well known Steps Riddim which was used by artist such as Assassin,  Wayne Marshall, TOK, Elephant Man and Bounty Killer.

Smoke’s passion for music is not only driven by Dancehall but even more Soca because of the vibes and energy this genre brings.

With his excellent attendance record and being a highly dependable and reliable Dj he is booked for all major soca events during Jamaica carnival. 
From hyping crowds in clubs like Fiction, Quad and Margaritaville to upscale events under the Frenchmen label (Blocko, Bazodee), Dj Smoke knows exactly what tunes to run to make you dance on your toes or how the Jamaicans say: “pan u head tap”.
Being part of Jamaica carnival and playing at Soca @de Sandbar, Beach Jouvert, Jouvert and the Carnival Road March Dj Smoke definitely put his name on the map for future Caribbean and International soca events.

Local Jamaican dancehall events like sumfest and ATI Negril week end allow Dj Smoke to show his skills every year and he surely doesn’t disappoint.

With excellent work relationships with well known artist like Beanie Man, Sean Paul, Elephant Man, Bounty Killer, Movado, Assassin, Alison Hinds, Fay-Ann and Bunji, Taurus Riley and international Djs such as Bambino, Duchess, Doggy Slaughter, Private Ryan, Back to Basic and Khaled Dj Smoke is definitely a selector to look out for.

His tag line “Lets Go” reflects his whole attitude: dynamic, fresh and energetic.

www.GoodForYouRecords.com  
DJing for 2 decades, Kenny Summit started his career like most DJs, spinning house parties in his home town of Linden New Jersey.  A chance encounter with the owner of the world famous nightclub Zanzibar in New Jersey landed Kenny his first ""club gig"" at just 16 years of age.  The following year Kenny Summit caught the eye of of famed NYC nightlife impresario Peter Gatien who gave Kenny the opportunity to spin on a monthly basis at the legendary Limelight alongside DJs like Moby, Jeff Mills, Keoki and Supa DJ Dimitri.  At 18 year of age Kenny Summit began playing on a weekly basis at clubs all over Manhattan.  That year, Ralph Lauren heard Kenny spinning at Limelight and invited him to DJ at his birthday party which furthered the ""buzz"" around Kenny's DJ popularity.  Before long Kenny was DJing at the biggest shows during NYC's Fashion Week, a stint that lasted over 10 years.  He became a staple in the fashionista scene which lead to gigs as far as Paris, Milan and Prag.  Kenny Summit played the best clubs in NYC for 20 years and in the summer of 2012 he decided to move to LA where he has relocated his label, Good For You Records.  GFY is a brand that reflects Kenny's love for quality music of all genres.  Kenny is presently releasing and making house music with the likes of Frankie Knuckles and Eric Kupper.  He also has his sights focused on quality hiphop with the signing of an acoustic jazz / funk / soul band called Sunny Daze who are working on projects with hiphop legends Grand Puba, the Artifacts and Rakim.

Born and raised in the Kingbridge section of the Bronx, New York. This 80's baby grew up through the notorious ""crack"" era that rocked New York City. The ever changing surroundings exposed this young artist to numerous experiences, trials and tribulations both good & bad. Forced to grow up fast, he soaked in game from his older peers finding out early the fruits of hard work.

New to the hip-hop game, Classic actually started rhyming as a challenge by his peers when he was still in high school. Classic friends always admired how he lived the ""quote on quote"" lifestyle of a rap star and challenged him to put his past and present experiences on paper.

As you can see Classic paints these pictures so vividly in his verses. After spending a couple of years battling other young hungry MC around the city, Classic decided to take his career to the next level.  Classic quickly learned that he had to develop his flow, cadence and song writing techniques such as hooks and the art of produced good music packed in to uniformed bars. Soon everyone will see there's a major problem brewing in the X... We going to bring it back to where it started! Bx Stand Up!

In 2010, he released the first of a three-part project-- City Light Soundtrack. The album was produced by Kerplunk! Studios' Kelvin Uy and Engineered by Pat Jalbuena. That same year, Carlos was invited to play two music festivals in Singapore: Kinestasia at Timbre and Baybeats Festival at the Esplanade. In support of that release, Carlos continued to play shows in the Philippines and around Asia. In 2012 Carlos released CLS part 2: PERMANENCE. This had him reach back deep into his roots of Motown, the Blues, and a whole lot of storytelling, as the album broke out singles ""After Everything"" and ""Bright Yellow"", with the latter breaking Carlos' dislike for music videos. The music video for ""Bright Yellow"" was directed by Natileigh Sitoy and enjoyed its own success, picking up awards along the way. 

In 2013, CLS part 3: THE END was released in Singapore, closing out the City Light Soundtrack series. 

Just this September, Carlos Castano became the FIRST Independent Filipino Musician to play in FORMULA 1 SINGAPORE, playing 4 shows in 4 nights at the Sail Stage, Sunset Stage, and Padang Grandstand (Coyote Stage).

Hillbilly haywire with a lonesome Kentucky edge that added a little chrome to those Cadillac pipes, it wasted no time in grabbing your soul by the lapel. When you listened to Gary Stewart sing, you kind of held your breath, wondering if he'd get out of the song alive. He'd swoop down on words, elongate syllables and growl around his range, then spit out the chorus. At a time when many roots - conscious rockers were trying to add a little country to their rock 'n' roll, Gary went the other way 'round with a vengeance. ""Stewart didn't really fit in anywhere,"" writes Jim Lewis. ""He wasn't Southern rock, and he wasn't Nashville country."" Amen to that. Gary Stewart was a weird, frustrating and often thrilling genre unto himself.",438,

Starting the music blog Paradise Beats in December 2010, Squires came on the dance music scene from a unique perspective. Driven by his love of producing and DJing, he continued the blog for two years while developing his sound and building connections and support. Squires gained first hand experience interviewing and spending time with some of the scene's most talented artists like Avicii, Deniz Koyu, Max Vangeli, and Norman Doray in addition to playing alongside 3LAU, dBerrie, The Disco Fries, EDX, and Mysto & Pizzi.

Starting by DJing parties at his college, Squires moved onto a much more legitimate DJ scene playing at nightclubs in NYC like Pink Elephant, Union Square Lounge, South Side, Parlor, The Griffin, The Royalton, and Hudson, concert halls in Syracuse like The Westcott, and pool parties on the beaches of Puerta Vallarta, Mexico. In addition, he was named a competition winner for an opening slot on Bounce Boat, New York's biggest EDM cruise, in the summer of 2012.

Furthermore, when running Paradise Beats, Squires hosted a radio show in which artists like Michael Brun, Ken Loi, David Puentez, Walden, and most recently Promise Land provided guest mixes. Continuing to develop his production skills, the New York native tends to blend a style of Progressive, Electro and Trance in his productions and mixes. Squires looks forward to an exciting 2013 filled with his most impressive productions and shows to date.",2015-01-04 02:27:44.354539,2015-01-06 21:19:22.98913,,,squires.nick@gmail.com,,t,265,10770466,new york city,,f,,f,OfficialSquires,,,,,

I Offer a truly an approach for Filmmakers and other Art makers seeking creative services for both the Music Composition and Technical Process to illustrate a project’s story. 

All I ever dream to do is help guide fellow artists into translating their vision into a sound aesthetic to help tell stories more clearly and develop characters people will remember and love. 
I've worked with not only Film-makers but Photographers, Dancers, Comic Book artists, Yoga instructors, Website developers, Book writers and other Composers and Musicians as well.

“A good score should have a point of view all of its own. It should transcend all that has gone before, stand on its own two feet and still serve the movie. A great soundtrack is all about communicating with the audience, but we all try to bring something extra to the movie that is not entirely evident on screen.” -Hans Zimmer - See more at: http://www.productionhub.com/profiles/details/243963#sthash.Bb8tAK0D.dpuf",2015-01-04 02:27:44.41574,2015-01-06 21:19:23.311719,,,darryljpadilla@gmail.com,,f,272,4581394,new york,,f,,f,Darryl-Padilla,,,,,

Pensando en como obedecer el mandato de Jesucristo a predicar el Evangelio se me ocurrió ""Generacion Fuerte""; pensé como este programa de entrevistas podia ser usado por Dios para de alguna manera alcanzar mas vidas con mensaje de consuelo o consejo en el momento oportuno. Se me ocurrio ""Generación Fuerte"". Basicamente sin ninguna experiencia previa en radio, este sería mi primer proyecto radial para consumo internacional, pero asi me atreví a comenzar a grabar los primeros programas. Me alegro mucho en haberlo hecho. He sido bendecido por las historias que muchos me han compartido acerca de como uno de los programas o de mis escritos en mi blog www.generacionfuerte.com han hecho la diferencia en sus vidas. En la actualidad Generacion Fuerte se transmite a través de muchas emisoras, cristianas y seculares. Regularmente me escriben diciéndome que se quedaron sorprendidos de haber escuchado mi programa en una radio emisora secular en un país u otro. Los programas estan disponibles en esta pagina para ser cargados a su computador y ser compartidos por todos con sus amigos y familiares y eso es lo que muchos hacen alrededor del mundo.

Raised in New York and from a Hispanic background DJ Finyl Faze grew up with a diverse world of music around him. From the gritty hard rap of Wu-Tang to the danceable salsa of Celia Cruz. He wasn’t introduced to djing until late in his life at the age of 22 by the Turntable Assassin DJ Kutcase. With his help and honest mentoring DJ Finyl Faze began honing his skills on the technics, and slowly started booking local parties and local clubs in the long island area.

A native of Brooklyn and current resident of Queens (New York), Jovonn has been active in the music scene since the age of 10. Supported by his mother, a keyboard player; and father, a guitar/bass player, who were aspiring R&B singers; he was nurtured with a solid musical foundation. Jovonn began his career as a Hip-Hop DJ at the age of 14 and started spinning records at those infamous New York block parties of the 80s where he was introduced to the growing New York House music scene, hanging out in seminal Brooklyn clubs such as Sapphires, Club Saturn and Club Serene. Year’s later clubs such as The Loft, The Choice, Snobbusters and Zanzibar solidified his full commitment to House music.

Jovonn exploded onto the house scene in 1991 with his second release, “Turn and Runaway” on Warner Bros. Records, which reached number 10 on the Billboard chart and catapulted Jovonn on to the global scene. In addition to being an internationally renowned producer and club DJ, as well as a singer, songwriter and musician, Jovonn, founded his first record label, Goldtone Records, in the early 1990’s via Emotive Records. Since then Jovonn has produced more than 200 records in the House, R&B, Hip-Hop and Neosoul genres, not to mention film scores and soundtracks. But it needs to be said that his true love has always been House music.

Some of Jovonn's house releases include ""Old Man Groan"", ""Jurassic House"", ""Circle Dance"", ""He’s More"" (feat. Carolyn Harding), ""Djoon"" (on UK Basic), ""Praise"" (on WestEnd Records), ""Dont Waste Your Time"" (feat. Stephanie Cook), ""The Spirit"" album (on Track Mode), the ""Blaque House"" album on Code Red as well as famous underground classics such as ""Back In the Dark"", ""Garage Shelter"", ""I Can't Make Up My Mind"", ""I Wanna Go To A Club"", that all contain Jovonn's distinctive vocal delivery and trademark production with his gritty sounds, hard kicks, jazzy chords and phat basslines.

His latest Dance record label ventures, NextMoov Records and NextMoov Traxx, are dedicated to releasing the hottest deep and raw underground house tracks from Jovonn and his crew of producers and vocalists. Look out for new releases on NextMoov and NextMoov Traxx and not to mention brand new original Jovonn productions and remixes on a whole host of the world’s best house labels.

Apart from Social Darwinism, the thing that separates these two men from the rest is their unsettling and uncanny ability to make love...

With live sets and productions that their own mothers describe as, “sounds nice, but a little loud,” these two always put on a show that was not ever described as sexy and life-changing, but should be.

Apart from their unique personalities and boyish good looks, they have many similarities. They each graduated from prestigious North-Eastern Universities, they like hot chicks in yoga pants, enjoy a good burger, and have been rejected from many of the venues they now play at. 

See them live and you will understand why the sky is blue...

He started spinning records at age 13 and has never looked back.  Playing shows around New York over the Years has made him stay True to himself and to all those who support his Music.  

His creativity in his Performances and the way he adapts to his settings, really Erupts anywhere he Spins at.  He has turned Non Believers into Believers as he's been told.  Taking the crowd Back In Time on a Musical Journey is what he is all about.  

Loosing His Older Brother who was such a Major supporter and Influence was the Toughest time for him but also was what drove him to finally take the next step into bringing his own tracks to the world.  

Saving up for equipment and in his spare time between working two jobs, he was determined to make it happen.  Teaching himself everything was what he did to take his Hobby & Dream to the next Level.  

He now has releases on Major Respected Labels plus support from many Major Artists.  Nick also runs his own Radio show ""New York Sessions"" on Fnoob Techno Radio in London.

Nick Hansen is no stranger to the Music. As a kid he was like a sponge soaking up the music from his older Brothers and New York + over the years from Artists like Chris Liebing, Adam Beyer, Victor Calderone, Junior Vasquez, Bad Boy Bill, Scot Project, X-Dream & many more.

He started spinning records at age 13 and has never looked back. Playing shows around New York over the Years has made him stay True to himself and to all those who support his Music.

His creativity in his Performances and the way he adapts to his settings, really Erupts anywhere he Spins at. He has turned Non Believers into Believers as he's been told. Taking the crowd Back In Time on a Musical Journey is what he is all about.

Loosing His Older Brother who was such a Major supporter and Influence was the Toughest time for him but also was what drove him to finally take the next step into bringing his own tracks to the world.

Saving up for equipment and in his spare time between working two jobs, he was determined to make it happen. Teaching himself everything was what he did to take his Hobby & Dream to the next Level.

He now has releases on Major Respected Labels plus support from many Major Artists. Nick also runs his own Radio show ""New York Sessions"" on Fnoob Techno Radio in London.

Nick has grown into his own Unique Sound that just keeps getting better and more Powerful. He has a special way of 
Telling A Story through his DJ Sets & Tracks, incorporating Old School & New School Sounds, Vocals, Rock, Funk & Dance Music. As an Artist he will continue to pour his Heart & Soul into all his music and bring his Passion to Dance Floors Worldwide.",1,

Bio-
DJ Lovaboi was born and raised in the beautiful island, Trinidad. He currently resides in the heart of the West Indian community of Queens, New York. Like Father, Like Son. His father was a DJ in his younger days, being the biggest influence in DJ Lovaboi’s career. The lively and energetic culture of the Caribbean's is only a plus to what makes DJ Lovaboi so versatile. His love for music didn’t stop when he moved to Queens, it only made him proactive in his DJ’ing career to show others what the Caribbean has to offer. In 2009 he began to play at various venues around Queens through the use of CD’s. With technology advancing, he was able to  grow as a DJ. In 2010 he was introduced to the Serato Scratch Live. Enabling him to perform at more venues and improve his skills. The love DJ Lovaboi has for music was seen through his talent by many. He was given the name, “Queens Youngest Talent” by a friend, DJ Skye. Being West Indian the indian roots of Chutney music and the Caribbean twist of Reggae music intrigued him to bring together the best of both worlds through his DJ’ing. In his latest release of Chutney Bacchanal, it features all of his favorites while growing up, he made this CD in hope of making everyone reminisce of their childhood when they listened. After Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 of Lovers Reggae being such a big hit he will also be releasing Lovers Reggae Vol. 3 soon. What is even more impressive is that he is able to create mix CD’s with Acid Pro. He has played at many renowned locations throughout Queens, such as: ViVa Lounge (Arena Lounge), Maracas Night Club, Level Ultra Lounge, RII Lounge (Rumors Lounge), Moka Night Club, UnderGround Lounge, Jouvay Night Club (Club Tobago), Tic Tavern Bar & Lounge, Flirt Lounge, Sparkles Bar & Lounge, Silk Bar & Lounge & Randy's Bar & Lounge.

Nick was raised in New Zealand on a diet of soul, reggae and hip-hop music, and spent the best part of a decade bouncing between Sydney, London and New York immersing himself in nightlife culture on as many levels as possible.

Housing Corp is the manifestation of Nick and Skyler's obsession with the low end rumblings of House and UK Garage, and its intersection with New York's prolific hip-hop culture.

The tight production unit evolved out of a series of very successful and well regarded underground parties, club residencies and festival appearances, and the duo have their sights firmly set on taking their sound to the world.

Nothing but years and large amounts of music make you critical and particular to what you like.

Having witnessed dance music revolutionized from UK Garage and 2 Step to its current trends Ellroy Clerk developed quite a unique musical identity. However dance music wasn't the only genre that influenced him. For a few years Ellroy Clerk got infatuated with Hip-hop and R&B which turned out to be extremely beneficial to his perception of music. Being able to play for different crowds helped him better understand how to work the room. Yet the final decision making mechanism came from his background in dancing. 

A year after residencies at a few night clubs he tried his hand at production. A vast research was made including gear, studio set up and DAWs basics. Ellroy Clerk would spend every single spare minute in front of a keyboard practicing. 

Currently Ellroy Clerk devotes all his time to music creation and mastering his skills. He is getting support from bigger names in the industry. 

Regardless of style he makes there is always something distinct in his music.

Despite being a self-described “yank“, the professor’s music clearly has southern and international influences throughout.

A trip through the musical catalog of Prof.Logik is like an extended trip back home to the community you grew up in. It may seem like a strange way to describe someone’s productions at first, until you experience the atmosphere, nostalgia, and melancholy of his music and beats.

Little Gregory got an early start in music. At 8 years old; his first set of turntables. At age 10; he used a twin tape deck to construct loops on cassette tapes. From there, he graduated to a Boss SP-303 (that he still uses today). Today his home studio, “Prof.Logik’s Lab”, incorporates many more instruments which are outlined at the bottom of this article.

When he’s not producing, he can be found digging through vinyl crates in the back of thrift and record stores around Asheville, North Carolina – Greenville, South Carolina – and his resident town of Spartanburg, South Carolina. Online he spends his time on Facebook and SoundCloud.

Prof.Logik sends shout outs to the entire borough of Queens, all of his followers (and those he follows) on SoundCloud, his Future Science label mates, his Skew Records label mates, Cascade Records, SFDH Heart:Beat Radio Show, Grappa Frisbee Records, and all of the blogs online that support and post his music for the world to hear.

316,St. Lucia,https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000084114659-lpjv46-large.jpg,"Even in the urban wilds of Brooklyn, there may be no one else like Jean-Philip Grobler, aka St. Lucia. Originally from Johannesberg, St. Lucia grew up performing with the Drakensberg Boys Choir School. When the choir wasn't traveling - they toured Japan, Australia, Europe and more - they stayed in an enclave tucked in the South African mountains, learning everything from Bach to minimalist opera.

A young musician could hardly find better training. But musically, St Lucia's heart lay elsewhere, and South Africa was full of other rhythms. ""My mom says I used to sing along to Michael Jackson,"" he says - an ordinary anecdote, until he adds, ""when I was an infant."" As a young teenager, he started to feel that he'd had his fill of classical, and it felt like an epiphany when he discovered the direct emotionality of pop. Eventually, he left the creative ""small pond"" of South Africa for England, where he spent three years studying music in Liverpool.

St. Lucia's journey ended - as so many journeys do - in New York City, where he started working on the tracks that would ultimately turn into his self titled debut release on Neon Gold. The atmospheric quality of St. Lucia's electronic pop is powerful, with the musician's global travels and history of secret hideaways effortlessly passed onto the audience through his dreamy, shimmering synths.

Neon Gold will release St Lucia's debut album later this year. Formerly a singles-only label that launched releases Passion Pit, Ellie Goulding, The Naked & Famous and helped launch the careers of countless others.

Formada em 2003, no Rio de Janeiro, o Moptop é formado por Gabriel Marques (voz e guitarra), Rodrigo Curi (guitarra), Daniel Campos (baixo) e Mário Mamede (bateria), que se juntaram com o objetivo de tocar rock. Entre as influências da banda, estão The Clash, The Cure, Ramones, Strokes, Beatles, The Killers, Los Hermanos, Franz Ferdinand, Klaxons e Arctic Monkeys, entre outros.

A banda começou com o nome ""DeLux"" fazendo músicas em inglês e tocando em shows pequenos. Em 2004, a banda mudou o nome para ""Moptop"" em homenagem ao corte do cabelo dos Beatles e começou a tocar em shows e festas maiores.

Um ano depois, a banda lançou a demo Moonrock conseguiu bastante sucesso e participa de importantes festivais de música independente do país. Além do Claro Que é Rock, estiveram no Coca-Cola Vibezone (RJ), o Bananada (Goiânia), MADA (RN) e o Humaitá Pra Peixe(RJ).

Em 2006, com seu nome consagrado no Brasil inteiro e ter aberto para bandas como Oasis e The Bravery, a banda assina com a gravadora Universal e começa a aparecer mais ainda para o grande público, como várias aparições na MTV e o sucesso O Rock Acabou tocando na rádio.

Depois de abrir alguns shows da banda escocesa Franz Ferdinand, a banda anunciou seu hiato sem previsão de volta. De acordo com a banda, o tempo será necessário para ""acertar"" a banda e para desenvolver projetos paralelos. A banda pretende retornar com um novo álbum e com o lançamento físico das músicas em inglês, quando aínda se chamavam ""DeLux"".

KASSIANO BIO...................................
Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil and based in New York, DJ and producer Kassiano has been for some time now a pioneer of 'brazilian dance music'.

As one of the first DJ’s to introduce Brazilian Baile Funk music to the international scene by putting out mixes, bootlegs, and original productions through his own label Nossa (since 2006), he innovated new ways of mixing the Rio favela sounds with other kinds of dance music from around the world.

Kassiano’s early remixes, bootlegs, and productions quickly earned him praise and features from magazines such as Bpm, Urb, Fader, and Xlr8r. Eventually Kassiano expanded his production horizons to work with major label artists like Lil Jon, for whom he produced the baile funk infused crossover club hit 'Machuka', for the album Crunk Rock. Other recent work has included official remixes for Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, T-Pain, Bart Bmore, Tommie Sunshine, and Green Velvet, as well as collaborative releases with the likes of Tommie Sunshine and Disco Fries.

-----------------------------
Taxonomy of the Psypien:
(Homo Sapien Psypiens- [psy-pɪˌɛn]) - A mammal of the primate order originally from Africa, that reached anatomical modernity about 200,000 years ago and began to exhibit full behavioral modernity around 50,000 years ago. In the late 90's he began to exhibit regular psytrance-listening behavior, and evolved into a producer in early 2012. Psytrance is Psypien's natural habitat; at once ancient/primal and futuristic/technological. It echoes the endless web of existence in which we live, and evolves with us with each step we take.

Psypien is the project of Oliver Z/L, who grew up in the forests of Vienna, Austria, and now lives among the humans of Brooklyn, NY, by way of California. Psypien aims to create evocative, powerful, and unique psychedelic sound, merging 'traditional' forest & full-on approaches with the more 'strange' and experimental; a soundtrack for a realm outside time & space. His mission is to stir up the spirits inside you, while freeing your body & mind. (and makin you feckin dance! ;)
