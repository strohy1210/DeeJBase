Hello,

I found this email on soundcloud, and I was wondering how much you might charge for a Friday night (from 11pm-3am or so) for a private party in NYC. Just looking for a general range.

The event would be a few months down the line with about 200 guests -  we're planning on renting out a bar or loft, it would be mostly people in their mid-late 20s, and we would provide speakers and lighting.

Best,
Sarah
