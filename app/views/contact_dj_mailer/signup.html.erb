Hello!
</p><p>
You're getting this email because you're a DJ in NYC! And you're also on soundcloud and seem to be hustling. Because of this, you have a profile on www.deejbase.com, which is a website that helps venues and event planners more easily hire DJs in NYC.
</p>
My name is Sarah. I'm also in NYC and love electronic music. We wanted to create a website that made it easier for good Djs like you to get gigs (and the not-so-good ones to not ruin our evenings unneccesarily).
</p>
<p>
Your profile is already up. <p> http://www.deejbase.com/djs/<%=@dj.id%> </p> All you need to do to claim it is:<br><br>
1. Log in to our site with facebook:  http://www.deejbase.com/auth/facebook
<p>
2. After you are redirected you must enter this secret code: <strong> <%= @sdcl_id %> </strong> - this links directly to the profile for <%= @dj.name%>. If this isn't you, please disregard.<br> 

</p><p>
Or you can visit www.deejbase.com directly to check it out. When you're ready, click "Log in with Facebook" in the navigation bar, then enter your code above.
</p>
<p>
At this point, we're a young company that just wants to make something useful. If you have any suggestions or questions, you can just reply to this email.
P.S. I'm a real human: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=624363

Best,<br>
Sarah</p>
