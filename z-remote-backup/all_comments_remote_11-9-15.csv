Even in the dead of winter the DJs here are such good quality that there is a line outside. We waited for about half an hour. Once you step inside and it is a really chill vibe, though you may not be able to see 1 foot in front of you because of the intense smoke machine. Would I come here again?

151,"Output has a terrific outlook on today's club/music/nightlife culture. Because they don't have bottle service/VIP/mean people, everyone in attendance is generally there for the love of the music (which is extremely refreshing!) Naturally, this attracts great talent and Thomas Jack was no exception. A stellar performance and demonstrating a real love of his craft (and his loyal fans), Jack kept true to his word and delivered an eight hour set of tropical house bliss through 5am. The ultimate testament to his character was coming down from the stage and meeting his most hardcore (insomniac) fans that stayed through the duration of the set, even posing for 'grams and Snaps with them. To top it all off, there was even an accompanying live sax. Incredible all around.",2015-02-21 20:47:49.832949,2015-02-21 21:04:17.90681,154

159,"I actually think given the genre and the main audience at Westway, the music is absolutely on point. As someone who grew up listening to hip hop, I liked that the DJ incorporated some key throwback songs from biggie to Ja Rule (lol) to bel biv devoe and mixed the old stuff in with songs from the top 10 charts. But, I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 because I think the DJ could have played more of the older stuff, but I think he didn't in order to appease the audience (primarily young 20-somethings who wouldn't know older hip hop).",2015-03-23 14:38:13.939062,2015-03-23 14:45:33.492438,162

206,"For a bar where people are not coming for the DJ, this guy was pretty good and deserves some kudos. Playlist was not the most fluid but he played a lot of really good (but not obvious) songs where you think ""oh shit, this song is great, probably heard it one or twice somewhere but have no idea what i's called"" good job. i love bk",2015-04-10 21:21:28.537151,2015-04-10 21:23:27.389669,209

207,Pretty chill unpretentious place in the LES. DJ Mop top performed in the basement. He played some early 2000's hip hop (not my fave genre but fun to hear now and then).

339,"Holy Ghost played an all vinyl dj set. While the dj set was good enough, I was pretty disappointed to not hear any Holy Ghost songs (at least in the time I was there). Alas, the lack of holy ghost and affordable alcohol encouraged us to go to a nearby dive with a jukebox. Good set, but not what I was hoping for.

Altho Turtle Bay is not a place I'd go for the music, if you want to hear something to dance to and you're in this part of town, it's not a bad choice.

227,"Ok, so the concept behind DayBreaker is too awesome to rate this less than 4 but I was honestly considering a 3/5 -here's my backup:

Pros: verboten was PACKED at *8am* on a wednesday with a crowd of fun-loving SOBER music lovers who were actually dancing and having fun.
You don't have to be a night owl or be on drugs to enjoy really great house music and the positive vibes that naturally come with it and this was a testament to that
The DJ - PjOE - was really really  good and they had this great violinist and sax players performing live over the music which was pretty cool (although maybe overkill at times - there were like 3 sax players).

So why not 5/5?

Cons: THE MC/singer OMG - He occasionally sung verrry well over the music but he INCESSANTLY interrupted the DJ telling everyone to ""Feel the music"" and shit. Like this is NOT Yoga, we can listen to the music and dance on our own without you saying ""yeah"" ""feel it"" every two seconds.
2nd gripe: at the end, they told everyone to sit down and then they just said thank you to everyone and promoted Earth Day and then there was these meditation exercises, which were cool but did you even donate anything to the Earth, this is a business so don't spend all this time trying to convince us otherwise.

That's all. In sum, worth going to at least once :)",2015-04-22 22:07:47.983845,2015-05-27 19:02:24.613196,230

649,"""Bushwick Afters"" as it is commonly referred to was like nothing I'd ever attended.

It started at 4am at a rooftop in a secret location in Bushwick.

My friends and I arrived around 4:30, apparently this is great as just a normal sleep-first-and-go daytime thing as well (it goes till 4 pm) but we caught all the people filtering in after all night parties - quite the crowd as you might imagine. Everyone was super friendly - talked to these two aussies who'd gotten out of the plane a few hours before and people who lived in brooklyn their whole lives. A friend of mine showed up in a suit cus he'd been out since work the previous day ha!...and the music! Amazing. They had a dj on the roof and one downstairs. It was bright up there (after 6am) and basically pitch black on the floor below. So you could pick your poison. But both djs were great. I would def def do this again - one of those unique experiences you can only have in a few cities across the world and even then, it won't be quite the same as in NY.",2015-06-22 11:57:37.443042,2015-06-22 15:30:52.967722,652

Upstairs, Shawn Dub was spinning hip hop (really nice stuff I'd never heard before) mixed with electronic. Transitions were on point. No one was dancing upstairs but the sound was amplified on the first floor for everyone down there to enjoy.

Would def come back here on Thurs-sat night when there were a few more people. Outdoor area was also really nice; since there are no large buildings around, you get this infinite view of the sky above. I think I even saw a star or two",2015-06-25 17:25:23.882469,2015-06-25 17:35:21.976202,699

DJ had some songs I like a lot - for example, a Thomas Jack jam and a disclosure- and let's be real - blank space by taylor swift (which he played thru the third verse, not great) but in no particular order and the transitions were abrupt.

In sum, go here if you're in the area and want to drink, maybe talk, and dance if the mood strikes. If you're looking for great djs/music, try the 303 @ louie and chan down the street.",2015-06-29 02:21:37.653175,2015-06-29 02:35:23.099788,727

The DJ 'we are temporary' played really dark techno and it was great. Then there was a live singer with  a guitar-player but you couldn't even see them cus the lights were shining at you and the fog was so thick. They were also very talented.

Then there was a girl painting and a guy doing live projection mapping on a white screen by the stage area. The images were creepy, dark and kind of sexual. Even though the soundsystem was meh, the talent and the weirdness of the whole thing earns the bar/party 4/5.

But a boat was maybe not the best setting for this type of music. Not as many people dancing (and not as many ppl in general) as at the blkmarket party on the cruise ship a month ago.
Also didn't have quite the same spirit, possibly bc it's no longer the beginning of summer.

777,"StageOne takes place in prime Williamsburg by the water every week throughout the summer. The event goes from 2-10pm, during which several djs take the stage.

Sasha, who headlined and was up last, was a bit inconsistent but had some brilliant transitions and breakdowns. And others told me Joris Voorn, who performed earlier in the afternoon gave them goosebumps.

Otherwise, being by the river, the sound wasn't amazing, unless you were standing front and center of the stage, and the grounds are nothing special to speak of. It was basically a parking lot surrounded by a metal fence with a stage on one end. I'd rather spend the extra time going deeper into brooklyn to a venue a little more secluded with more places to relax and more greenery.

JK. 

Powerslug ran this night, with Ari Zaire and Gratuit playing. The environment is really spectacular. I believe what really distinguishes an alright DJ from a true showstopper is how they can customize and leverage their performance, tweaking it to the scene. They had this down to a tee here. It's a great venue that caters to a more intimate crowd. It's not sceney but certainly not trashy. Dancing is very much a thing here, and the lights are so dark that everyone gets into it. 303 knows who they're booking and I would feel comfortable consistently recommending this as a LES Sam Power Pick™ for great night.

And... on a more serious note, (sorry), I know this isn't the place but I am obliged to say -- this is one of THOSE place that refuses to serve free tap water and charges $8 for bottled water. Fuck off. This is criminal in my eyes and should be illegal.

899,"Honestly was a little disappointed when I first arrived last Fri night and there was no outdoor area here. I don't know why I assumed there would be one - probably because there was this 12-hr long 4th of july bash here (i can't imagine being in that small-for-bushwick, but still large-for-manhattan area for a whole daytime event during the summer).

That all said, once I came to terms that this was just a cool little dance club with no cool bushwicky outdoor space, I realized lot 45 is cool spot. I was there for an event hosted by Playdate. Chris walker from walker & royce was on when I arrived and he was really awesome.  The sound system was top notch as well. Not too many people were there but those that were were enjoying the music and dancing-face.

845,"Was here on a Tuesday evening for a Bastille Day celebration (basically the French 4th of July).

Le bain has all the right stuff: French name, GORGEOUS rooftop space, tastefully decorated with  green, grass-like floor (ok, it was turf but it looked good) and pastel pink lounge couches, and a great view of the hudson and the city (and the sunset). Also a 'pool' on the floor below (altho it's hot tub-sized) that no one was in.

The DJs were also good. Antoine Karl who hales from France but is based in NYC was on at sunset. He played deep house with transitions that were... intergalactic (i think you know what I'm sayin). Before him, was this funky disco duo Chordashian (clever). Good set for happy hour loungey type experience.

That all said, as typical with hard-to-get-into Meatpacking District clubs, despite average good-lookingness and well-dressedness being high, only a few ppl looked like there were having that much fun or were dancing.

Also being on a windy roof doesn't put the sound system in the best light. But that was ok.

Tl;DR An exquisite rooftop with good music - go with good ppl and make your own fun. Also have a way of not waiting in line.",2015-07-15 17:10:41.599338,2015-07-23 14:28:07.583077,848

1027,"Black Flamingo is a cool little basement club below a vegetarian restaurant tucked away by the Williamsburg bridge (only a few blocks from where yours truly resides). Not a place you'd just stumble in.

When we made our way downstairs, the room was surprisingly dark. A bit too crowded when I arrived around 12:30am on Thursday night. Sound was solid, but probably only because the acoustics are usually good when you're in a relatively small-sized box- but anyway, we're not grading on effort.

The Dj spun some disco funk type music which I liked a lot. The crowd was good but the vibe was a bit weird in that you couldn't actually see the DJ in the corner of the room but everyone was still awkwardly facing him, which meant staring at eachother's backs. Also, compared to deep house for example, I think disco warrants dancing with your peers a bit rather than zoning out by yourself.

Goldcap and Sabo from LA were on during the meat of the event, like 2-5 ish. Middle-Eastern sounds were incorporated into a beautiful set.

NY-based Illich Mujica closed at sunrise with upbeat grooves. He incorporated 'teardrop' by Massive Attack (theme song from the show 'House') which was an awesome surprise - I was dancing in a circle with friends making up lyrics to sing along to the instrumentals, which for some reason ppl around me enjoyed. Less fluid of a performance than goldcap and sabo but he was jumping around and everyone was having a blast.

809,"Taken squandered a lot of potential and certainly their ticketholders goodwill for future events. Very pricey tickets translated into a unique but not very compelling experience. We all met up at an ‘abduction point’ that was a block south of Pacha. After waiting a couple hours to get on a bus while surrounded by men in gas masks and ski masks, we were given a ‘Taken’-branded eye mask and loaded onto buses. They should have first locked our phones (like Zhu) as everyone’s first reaction was to try to guess our ‘secret’ destination. Once at the venue, 2 girls in lab coats handed out shots. We also got a mug shot photo of ourselves as well. Beyond that, this was just like any other dark club venue.

908,"Verboten always has great djs so I hate to knock it and I know 3 out of 5 is not a great score for a place that takes so much pride in who they have perform. But you know when you see a band and the microphone is on too loud and it squeaks? That kept happening last Thursday night even thought there was no microphone. Don't know what was going on. Also the dj wasn't really doing it for me regardless.

Output will just always be better all else equal.  Also the visuals at verboten behind the dj sometimes feel random.

The we in cloudz crew also played good sets. Wasn't blown away by them or Wankelmut from Germany who headlined.

Also, weirdly the party abruptly ended at 10 when it was supposed to end at 11.

Warehouse style venue with stage upfront, little outdoor smoking area and bar foyer right when you walk in.  Arrived at around 12:30 and a bunch of people were dancing to some sort of reggae type electronic music. No lights but sound was good.

A guy named Iemanjo was playing live trumpet over the DJ, which was awesome.. Really diverse local and friendly crowd. Love finding new places like this in the less obvious parts of brooklyn.

Fun ppl, vibes. Someone gave my bf a goblet of juice? and anointed him the king of halloween bc he loved his costume so much. Not much in terms of lights. Pretty techy fast-paced music. Didn't have the slower melodic deep house stuff I love love.  Sound was good in the main room; in the side room you could hear a bit of the main room's sounds coming in, which isn't ideal.  Ultimately I miss the outdoor parties we had over the summer, but unfortunately we can't have that anymore now that it's cold. Meow.",2015-11-03 15:04:31.980468,2015-11-03 15:17:14.841795,1212

981,"Interesting spot. Went because it was on Jukely, which means the concert was free. Also my boyfriend wanted to go. Enjoyed Colleen Green, who performed last. The instrumentals were Nirvana esque.

Pros:
Good sound.
Good performers.
Like the random space in BedStuy/Bushwick -  literally a parking a garage with DIY bar in the back.

Cons:
Maybe this is just cus im used to the electronic music crowd dancing their faces off but it's just weird to me when ppl just stand there when someone's performing. Even though, the spaced was pretty filled, there wasn't much enthusiasm.
It was hot and stuffy as balls and there was no escape but to go outside (might have contributed to ppl's lack of movement)

Fun ppl, vibes. Someone gave my bf a goblet of juice? and anointed him the king of halloween bc he loved his costume so much. Not much in terms of lights. Pretty techy fast-paced music. Didn't have the slower melodic deep house stuff I love love. Sound was good in the main room; in the side room you could hear a bit of the main room's sounds coming in, which isn't ideal. Ultimately I miss the outdoor parties we had over the summer, but unfortunately we can't have that anymore now that it's cold. Meow.",2015-11-03 15:17:52.258345,2015-11-03 15:18:11.019583,1214

1213,"Fuckin. Dance. Party. Moonboots rocked the house this past Thursday, kicking off an awesome Halloween weekend.

Ppl were getting down and grooving to some disco/deep house and it was just plain fun and energetic. Sound was good. Moon Boots was also boppin along like a teenager behind the booth.  Lot of fun , will def see him again. As I say in every review of Verboten though, it's not as good as Output.",2015-11-03 15:18:28.552313,2015-11-03 15:21:38.939277,1216

968,"SICK. First off, the venue, in red hook, brooklyn was this crazy industrial wasteland by the East River. Surrounded by (one in particular) HUGE warehouse that a girl ended up scaling up and down around sunset (with a guy thru a window at the top holding her on a rope). RAD.

There were no huge names headlining which made the tickets more affordable than say Electric Zoo or any other big festival and weeded out ppl there just so they can see XYZ because they liked their hit single ""I feel so close"".  AND what I really liked about this was that the majority of the DJs seemed SUPER excited to be performing for us - like maybe this was the biggest crowd they played for. Autograf at the fire stage was particularly excited and great.

There were 5 stages of DJs with slightly different types of electronic music. The biggest stage had TRAP - not my thing but the stage itself was awesome. One was more progressive house, and the others deep and tech house...i think- im not really that good at genres.

There were also randomly people doing dirt bike tricks at a ramp set up next to one of the stages. Also a bouncy castle and a bunch of art too! And the weather was perfect to top it all off.

One of the most unique and awesome festivals I've attended.",2015-08-24 20:37:13.596246,2015-08-25 18:24:45.903957,971

1041,"Get to Berry Park around 6:40 on a Sunday. Not too crowded but a good number of people and sun is setting.

This is really pretty rooftop bar that attracts non-locals and locals alike right by Mccarren park in Green Point. It has a beautiful view of the east river and if you move to one end of the bar you can see the sun itself.

This is not a place you go to to dance; the music wasn't very loud even - oral socialization is the encouraged form. It is is also a restaurant and people are sitting eating at tables as well.

All that said, I really appreciate the djs in the corner of the bar. Upon some research, they are called the Brochacho DJs and they spin every Sunday while it's warm. They played some hip hop throw backs that were tasteful and fun and dancey but not overpowering; truly playing to the crowd and also taking care to transition well.

Pleasantly surprised, Berry Park - ill have to come back at night when people are actually throwing down a bit more.",2015-08-31 14:57:48.721587,2015-08-31 15:14:22.189088,1044

1045,"This is my first review of the ROOF at Output.

It's Sunday, I'm bored and have some time to kill. I snag a free pass to Output on Jukely just in case I decide to go. I arrive around 4:30. Ryan Crosson will be performing on their rooftop. I've been on Output's roof before but never when the dj was performing out there.

The first section of the roof is filled with people chatting and hangin out- smoking. The dj is another section of the roof that's not open during normal nights at output. It's a very narrow space with not a lot of room in front of the dj but it still works. The floor is fake grass -easy on the knees. Anyway, Shaun Reeves spun some really fun deep house. Followed by Ryan Crosson. Sound system up there is also on point and you get a great view of manhattan. Also what's nice about sundays on the roof is that you don't get that ""i just want to go clubbing cus its sat night"" crowd. It was a fun group of people.

1061,"Ezoo was a solid in 2015. Production was great, 4-5 stages - the main stage shot 100 feet in the air and had some awesome lights -specifically the lasers that shot across the top of the thousands of attendees. Love the fact that its always on an island off of Manhattan and there's plenty of grass to chill out on - you don't get that at every festival.

Top-notch ACTS that covered an array of genres within the electronic umbrella.  It's changed a lot since 2011 and im nostalgic for those days: when calvin harris played at 4pm as did alesso who headlined this year - altho i didn't think he was anything to write home about. Glitch mob in tent was my fave  - they had a lot of energy, some cool synth instruments and drums - altho they are kind of dubsteppy, which is not what im normally into. Thomas Jack was just ok - he put on a much better performance at Output than he did on the riverside stage at zoo.

Crowd was meh, a lot of 'pacha' types coming in from all over the tri-state area but that's to be expected now that pure edm is kind of beyond its heyday. Crowd also swayed younger - 22,23 on average, also normal.

Ezoo bucks really grind my gears - so you pay $40 to fill up your bracelet and that translates to 18 ""ezoo bucks"". Why would they make us do math? Cus they want to trick fucked up kids into thinking everything is cheaper - even tho it was all a total rip off ($10 for a beer). Altho this ploy won't affect the rating, it's still something you should know and may have diminished the overall vibes, don't try to screw your crowd Made Event - we're on to you, it's just not worth it.

Mostly hip hop at this loungey club on a rooftop around times sq. Random mostly out-of-town crowd. Heard ppl speaking a melange of languages. One table was a bachlorette party who i offered a dollar to give me a slice of cheese from the spread on their table. I'd forgotten to eat dinner. They accepted the bill.

When I arrived, the dj was spinning upbeat hip hop/pop with some electro elements. Then my fave imaginary numbers came on for 15 min with some dirty techno which was kind of random but also awesome.

1076,"Brooklyn mirage was quite awesome again even on a rainy Sat (despite the fact they didn't let anyone in til almost 2 hrs after the show was supposed to start - wack). I guess they weren't sure it would rain so they ended up having to set up inside. hmm.

It was an RPM event with Nicole Moudabar and friends. Dark berlin warehouse techno, a lot of bass, deep ominous vocals interspersed. Nicole was good altho a bit minimal for my tastes - I heard her closing set kinda sucked cus the bass went out. I preferred Lauren Lane who followed and then Hector from Mexico who was on after that. They had a little more going on in their sets.

KV2 sound system was awesome. Not much by way of lights inside the warehouse but that makes sense given the type of music - not EDM.

1081,"The House of Rob block party was off the chain this past Wednesday at pacha. The event was organized to raise money for the family of the late Rob Fernandez, pacha's music director for many years, and obviously great guy because all (I'm talking upwards of 50) of these world-class djs including Kaskade and Erik Morillo came back to the club to pay their respects to a man many credit with their success - as Kaskade said, Rob used to bring him back to the club to DJ even when it was empty, he believed in him.

Kaskade's set pre-sunset outside the club was short and sweet. Hadn't seen him in a while but I realized I love him just as much as a I did a few years ago when i saw him 3 times in the same calendar. He has this ability to build up an awesome drop and then bring you right back in to it after with soothing happy melodies and dirty undertones.

He closed the set with his hit remix of Deadmau5 ""I remember"", which was incredibly appropriate and nostalgic, not to mention an awesome song, one of the first one's  I loved when I started getting deep into the house scene.",2015-09-18 16:25:32.174092,2015-09-18 16:54:52.71054,1084
1215,"The Shop is a really cute little restaurant/music venue. Turn it up played a Weezer cover set here on Halloween evening - the band were all in costume and really got the crowd going. The incredibly good-looking lead singer dressed as Bowie from The Labrynth was encouraging the crowd to come up and help him sing!  This pudgy guy dressed as a banana (with some coaxing from his buddies) ended up on stage belting out the words to the sweater song. It might have been one of the best days of his life. There were a few other bands that night playing covers of groups such as the The Strokes and Nirvana.

It was intimate but wild - a lot of people jumping up and down, embracing, and singing along together. Only negative might be you can't really escape the stage and music; it's all one big room. Not a ton of production - just a stage- but it did the trick. A DJ spinning hip hop came on after the bands which was pretty cool as well.

More packed and basic crowd than I've experienced on previous non-tiki-disco output roof parties- there was nowhere to sit on the top/bar/smokig level and not much room on the dance/dj level either.

1127,"I will start by saying Chvrches' live performance lived up to the their extremely satisfying recorded tunes. And the lead singer Lauren Mayberry is awesome - adorable with her Scottish accent and tinyness, yet also funny and commanding. The sounds the trio produce are so beautiful and balanced.

Summerstage in Central Park itself was OK. The sound and lights were good - Chvrches had a sweet LED backdrop, but apparently that's not typical for the venue - usually its just the standard headlights. And it's cool being the middle of central park - in nature sort of.

That said, it was crowded AF, like you could barely move; forget about meeting up with people further up than you- I wanted to get another beer but there was no way I was going to be able to get back to my friends without telling about 100 people - ""hey excuse, me umm sorryy could you please umm...stapler"".

So basically you couldn't dance like crazy, doing spin moves, and flailing arms around, which is a bummer because they have some pretty upbeat songs.  Also the standing area starts to slope down as you go back, so for someone who's say... 5'3.5, it's difficult to see much unless you're up close.  I rarely got a glimpse of Lauren and only saw the top of the LED lights with some effort.

TL;DR the show was good (especially when it started to rain slightly towards the end and everyone was cheering together :)), but I will probably avoid Summerstage in the future.",2015-09-30 15:15:48.572067,2015-09-30 17:25:21.657609,1130

763,"I finally understand why everyone goes crazy over CityFox and why it's worth the extra cost. Amazing DJs and sound - consistently.  That's not all that contributes to a great party but it sure as hell aint a bad start.

CityFox typically throws their parties in a huggge warehouse in Bushwick (not far from where Chromed hosts their events). For the 4th of July, it was at the same place, but the promoter also unveiled a new venue outside of it called ""The Brooklyn Mirage"", a huge area with 2 bars, finished rooftops with beautiful views of Manhattan, a stage, as well as REAL palm trees for decoration!

Only negative of the event was the indoors area being sweltering hot, which was a pretty large fuckup, especially given it was pretty cool for the 4th of july (high of 75) - imagine if it were a hotter day? Also apparently the day party started 2 hrs late?

Besides those hiccups, the music could not have been better, thanks to the amazing DJs and the KV2 audio system.

I was here for the nighttime event although some say the daytime was even better.  At night, there were two rooms with djs performing in each, whereas during the day, the djs performed on the outdoor stage in succession.  My fave of night was Behrouz who had this dreamy, high-pitched, middle-eastern sounding singing mixed into the set. Tale of Us and Bedouin also tore up the decks.

The enormous space and having your choice of stages made it feel more like a mini music festival than a regular warehouse party. At the end of night (early morning) many party animals chilled on the decorated couches in batches throughout the venue.

tl;dr CityFox was a blast. Top-notch music, sound. Huge space gives a wild vibe that other party-throwers might find hard to mimic",2015-07-06 14:21:02.404358,2015-09-30 14:51:35.213115,766

1193,"Brooklyn Bowl is a Williamsburg staple - there's no place in Manhattan quite like it and its proximity to the Bedford L as well as attractions such as Output, Brooklyn Brewery and The Wythe hotel draws people from all over the city. Good crowd last night (old and young, less hipster-broey than usual, some foreign) for Joy formidable's CMJ show.

The size of the space is comparable to Music Hall of Williamsburg and the lights and sound are almost as good (unfortunately the music last night was drowned out slightly by the loud bowlers next to the stage).

Although Brooklyn bowl is not only a music venue, but also a restaurant and (you guessed it) a bowling alley, the place brings in pretty high-level acts and most ppl do come for the music. Bc of all the other things going on you a feel a bit more like you're watching a low key show and somewhat closer to the performers than you would elsewhere. Also, there isn't a speaker fortress separating the stage from the audience as there is at music hall down the street. The performers can look audience members in the eye and even hop off the stage for a bit if they want- ive seen it before!  makes you feel more like you're in it with them.

1153,"MSG has top-notch production unless you are in the nosebleed section, which I was in.

Even so, Zedd's spectacle last Friday was impressive - the lights were INCREDIBLE. At one point, it looked like he was riding on a DJ-mobile through time and space on a multicolored path -  exactly like in rainbow road in Mario Kart.

The songs were super poppy and vocal heavy; to give you a sense of how far this goes, one of his songs features former Disney channel star Selena Gomez (whom he now dates).   Light happy sing-along tunes are not my ideal within the electronic genre but that doesn't mean I can't succumb to the wide-reaching appeal from time-to-time.

That said, kind of like Jerry Seinfield who argues with Elaine that he has to take the one first class seat (they're on their way somewhere and get 1 upgrade between the two of them) because he's been in it before and she hasn't and if she takes it he'll suffer more in Coach because unlike her he KNOWS HOW MUCH BETTER IS.

Well that's sort of how I felt.  This was my 2nd electronic show at MSG, the first was nearly 4 years ago for the first edm show at MSG (Swedish House Mafia) and I had one of the best nights of my life. The sound and lights were also impeccable altho admittedly not quite as over-the-top. I knew and loved all the words, screaming out the lyrics ""From Miami to Ibiza!!' and the wonderful Coldplay remixes. It was hard not to compare or to not have wished we were down a little bit lower immersed more in the sound and lights.

Tl;dr As far as a free show gets, Zedd was pretty great and I had a killer time with my friends. Of course, I'd be back at MSG for the right performance and another good deal",2015-10-06 13:06:19.222978,2015-10-06 14:20:45.650835,1156

The music was poppy but actually not bad. Sound was meh but people were dancing in the back. It wasn't too crowded but it was also something like 3am by the time we arrived. Free to get in .

1174,"Expert musicians. That's how i'd describe The War on Drugs who performed at music hall this past Wednesday

Didn't really know much about the band before I went to the show- listened to a few of their recordings and thought they sounded 'chill'. The lead singer's voice sounds very similar to Bob Dylan or Tom Petty. Classic classic rock sounds as my friend Howie put it.

That said, the performance really blew me a way. Their live skills outdid their recordings. If i remember correctly, the band had 6 pieces:
1. lead singer/guitar/harmonica
2. bass guitar
3. other guitar
4. drums
5. keyboardist/trumpet player/saxophonist
6. other synth guy with a lot of wires, couldn't really see what he was doing

The guy playing the sax/trumpet, keyboard combined with lead guy's guitar and occasional harmonica memorized me; the compostions were beautifully crafted and executed. Dare I say this reminded me of listening to deep house. I know it's not the same but it took hold of me and let me lose myself in a similar way.

I also have to say this would have been prefect if only it had ended sooner. Not that the show was too long, but I did feel the later songs were not different enough from the earlier ones and I was less ensconced as the performance progressed.

TL;DR, very impressed by the war on drugs; music hall is a great venue. Cool lights, great sounds, perfect for indie/rock shows.",2015-10-09 20:14:16.096861,2015-10-09 20:31:57.434983,1177

1086,"I had high hopes but the disruptive patterns party thrown by rinsed was kind of a let-down. My expectations were high partially bc I heard they threw an awesome 'coke yacht' party on a boat a few months back. Also Timeout dubbed this one of the best parties of the week. And their fb page is kind of mysterious and comical - they label themselves as a church/religious organization....and I like that kind of sarcasm :)-.

Negatives: The party was held 'at a secret location in brooklyn so I was thinking warehouse type DIY space, but the venue looked like it used to be a sleazy nightclub- the outside had huge tacky LED lights advertising the name of the venue. It had booths for bottle service and shit; there was no bottle service, but still - not exactly the underground vibes I was expecting. It was also a bit too crowded and the crowd was meh. Young on average and seemed like a bunch of college kids that didn't go to the same school.

Positives: when we arrived, there was cool projection mapping on a bunch of the walls. And there was a short dance number from a group of talented people wearing white, which made the performance kind of trippy as the projections blended in with the performers. The music was good. Tribal type house - not my personal fave but fun and tasteful.

Tl;dr even though I was slightly disappointed by venue/crowd the art aspect/music were solid.",2015-09-21 21:10:32.722475,2015-10-13 22:25:26.484547,1089

The Devotion team did it again at their ""technocolor dreams"" party. Perfect crowd - very open - be who-you-are. no judgement - type vibes.  Minimal creeping. Beautiful big dance floor, an outdoor area and a cool body paint and chill out space in the side room. There was this carpeted gazebo thing in the chillout area, inside of which I found an old dude sitting cross-legged reading this girl's palm and then a younger guy next to him. I waited and asked to have my palm read next. The old man took my hand and inspected it. He then whispered to the younger man in some south asian language? Then the younger man relayed the message to me. There were like 4-5 exchanges like this. Don't remember all of it but it was some insightful shit - I found myself nodding in agreement - this man was a profit. Always keep my family in my heart or something. Afterward, I asked to pay the guy, and he said how much would you pay? And I said, I don't know - 5 bucks? and he responds ""you must give that money to someone hungry"" I said ""ok"" he said ""you promise?"" I said yes, and I will - it's his money!

I was at the no sleep halloween party at the same venue two weeks ago. The quality of everything at this party was better, and I gave that other party a 4/5 rating. Animal trainer was amazing and so was Alan Nieves with his 6am set. He played this one progression with this beautiful high pitched melody over something deep and funky. It was like listening to two beautiful songs at once - you could pick which sound to focus on and which would be the nice backdrop.
